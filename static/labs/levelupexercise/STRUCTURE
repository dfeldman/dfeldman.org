Workout Data Structure Specification
Overview
A Workout represents a complete exercise session. It contains metadata about the workout and a series of exercise intervals. The structure supports all workout types (cardio, strength, flexibility) and both timed and untimed exercises.
Base Workout Properties

type: string (required) - One of: "run", "bike", "swim", "row", "strength", "flexibility"
level: number (required) - Workout level (1-100)
description: string (required) - Human-readable title/description (e.g., "Power Running Intervals", "Upper Body Strength")
units: string (required) - Either "imperial" or "metric"
phase: string (required) - Training phase (e.g., "basic", "intervals", "endurance", "build", "power")
totalDuration: number (required) - Total workout time in seconds
notes: string[] (optional) - Array of form cues or important reminders
formCues: string[] (optional) - Array of form-related instructions

Intervals Structure
The workout contains a sets array. Each set can be repeated and contains intervals:
[
    {
        repeat: number,  // How many times to repeat this set
        intervals: [     // Array of intervals within this set
            // ... intervals (see below for types)
        ]
    }
]
Interval Types
Base Interval Properties (all intervals have these)

activity: string (required) - Name of activity (e.g., "Run", "Chest Press", "Rest")
intensity: string (required) - Descriptive intensity (e.g., "Easy", "Moderate", "Hard")
description: string (optional) - Additional instructions

Timed Cardio Interval
Used for running, biking, etc.
Additional properties:

duration: number (required) - Time in seconds

                    duration: 120,
                    type: "circuit_rest"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    notes: [
        "Keep core engaged throughout",
        "Focus on form over weight"
    ]
}
This structure allows for:

Consistent representation across workout types
Support for both timed and untimed exercises
Clear progression through workout phases
Easy conversion between unit systems
Flexible display options
Timer compatibility
Circuit training support

Unit Handling Notes:

Distances stored in miles or kilometers based on units property
Weights stored in pounds or kilograms based on units property
Paces stored in time per mile or time per kilometer
Durations always in seconds regardless of units system


ISSUES:
Missing Base Properties:


None consistently set the 'units' property
Most don't explicitly set 'phase'
'totalDuration' isn't consistently calculated or set


Structure Issues:


Swimming generator doesn't use proper sets/intervals structure - it's using an older format with array of laps
Biking uses targetMetrics inconsistently
Running generator sometimes puts pace/distance info at workout level instead of interval level
Strength doesn't properly handle circuit vs regular rest periods


Interval Type Issues:


Strength workouts aren't properly setting 'type' ("machine", "free_weight", "bodyweight")
Rest intervals don't specify type ("rest" vs "circuit_rest")
Flexibility intervals missing 'targetArea' property
Some intervals missing 'description' property
'intensity' isn't consistently set across all intervals


Unit Handling:


None of the generators handle the unit system conversion
Paces and distances aren't being adjusted based on unit system
Weight values aren't being converted between lb/kg


Data Organization:


Some workout properties are being stored at top level that should be in intervals
Inconsistent handling of sets/repeats structure
Some generators still using old array formats instead of nested sets/intervals

To fix this, we should:

Create a standardized workout object creator
Add unit system handling
Properly structure all intervals within sets
Add missing required properties
Convert existing generators to use the new structure
