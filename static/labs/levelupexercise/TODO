NECESSARY:
- Interval timer - add back intensity and pace information
   -  add a intervalHtml element and use it in both workoutHtml and timer
   -  use styling from Swimming (looks nicest)
   - Make Skip button change to Continue on non-timed intervals
   - does not work on swimming at all
- Add history tracking and export
- Add level save/restore; separate for each category...
- Interval timer - add easy/medium/hard at end of workout
- Change level selector. Make it so you can either Level Up! if you are ready,
or select level manually
- Keep seeing 0-minute rests. Oops. Also Plank with unknown time...
- Flexibility screen is not working at all

NICE TO HAVE:
- Flexibility - Add timer support
- Add switch between km and mph (including pace and speed) and lb/kg weight and yard/meter for swimming? (not sure if needed)
- Interval timer - add sounds for warmup/start/rest/cooldown/complete
- Make HTML between cardio workout types consistent. Swimming looks the nicest right now
- Add back simple calorie estimate
- animations/colors
