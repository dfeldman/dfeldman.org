But like the rest of the technology landscape, the explosive growth of Batch, ML, and GenAI workloads alongside existing, often business-critical, workloads creates new challenges for end users running on Kubernetes.In previous technology cycles, the most likely outcome would be the rise of a new platform. However, due to the declarative API, the modular and extensible nature of the platform, and the strength of the ecosystem, Kubernetes can evolve in ways that were more difficult for previous platforms.Google is significantly re-focusing and increasing our already industry-leading investment in Kubernetes to refactor, extend, and even re-invent significant aspects of Kubernetes to meet the needs of the next decade.

Unfortunately, the Kubernetes extended resources API does not have enough information and does not give you control over which specific devices are assigned.

    "abstract": "Open source rules the world, and for a good reason: The code is generally better and more secure, bugs are fixed faster, and more. Virtually all modern applications run on it. But the landscape has changed since the early Linux days. Nights and weekends, volunteer-led projects are increasingly rare. Especially in the CNCF landscape, open source is maintained almost exclusively by companies that pursue a strategic goal, and they need a business justification for paying their engineers. So, who writes the code has changed, but the community's expectations — that it should be free — hasn't. While open source will remain free, the companies behind it must find ways to monetize it — whether through support, enterprise editions, or licensing models. Recent changes, including projects like Terraform, Flux, and Linkerd, highlight the need for a paradigm shift. Join this panel to hear from project maintainers why that is and the future they envision.",

But managing access to multiple external domains within the service mesh can be daunting. Discover the secrets behind building a powerful Internet Egress gateway using Istio and Envoy. This enlightening talk unveils a way to define fine-grained access policy to monitor and audit outgoing traffic from your mesh network. Besides, it demonstrates how to build a generic multi-tenant gateway that can be used across heterogeneous services and save years of repeated engineering work. By the end of the talk, attendees will gain an understanding of what an Internet Egress Gateway is, why it is necessary, and how they can configure it for their own services using the open-source Istio/Envoy based solution.",

Users only need to add storage nodes and computing nodes to the cluster as needed. However, we also encountered many scalability challenges when building TiKV - the stateful storage layer of TiDB. Challenges such as workload skew issues making it difficult to scale performance, management challenges of millions of dynamic data partitions, latency impact during scaling, interference between different workloads when consolidating multiple workloads into the same cluster, etc. In this talk, I will provide an in-depth look at these challenges and our solutions.",

Do you remember the pain of upgrading to a new Kubernetes API version like Ingress v1? Do you get a little twinge any time you see a feature or API deprecated in release notes? This is the talk for you. Kubernetes versioning is surprisingly complex and widely misunderstood. This talk will cover all the relevant versioning concepts, from storage versions to feature gates. It will show how they interact with each other, and how you can use this information to safely and confidently upgrade your clusters and controllers. This talk will provide real examples of how versioning mixups can lead to broken clusters and downtime. You’ll learn exactly how you can avoid each of these potential failure modes, and gain some insights into how API and Controller authors are trying to minimize the impact of these kinds of changes in the future.",

While service dependencies are often difficult to track, the rise of zero instrumentation Observability tools has eased access to this data, providing a potential baseline for AuthZ rules. Projects such as CNCF Pixie and Hubble expose language agnostic protocol traces providing full visibility of their environments. Pixie even supplies access to the span payloads making L7 analysis possible. In this talk, we present a case study of using Pixie to generate OPA policies for Envoy AuthZ using real traffic.

While there are lots of deaf engineers, until recently, most conferences — and virtually any other community activity — haven't been accessible to deaf community members. But for KubeCon, that all changed exactly a year ago! During this discussion, deaf panelists from various countries will shed light on their unique experiences being deaf in tech and the impact that making KubeCon accessible has had on their lives and hopes for the future. Attendees will learn why the technology space is a great fit for deaf individuals, the benefits and opportunities deaf professionals bring to the table, and what it takes to be an accessible and welcoming community. Panelists will also debunk common misconceptions and empower *you* to take steps toward a more inclusive cloud native ecosystem.",

To combat this complexity, Cilium explored using eBPF to implement pod-to-pod multicast delivery within a Kubernetes cluster. This talk will provide both a high and low level understanding of how eBPF can be used to implement multicast delivery. It will discuss how Cilium’s multicast works and the hurdles faced by the project along the way. By the end of this talk the audience will have a better understanding of how multicast functions, how eBPF can be used in-place of traditional multicast infrastructure, and how Cilium can be used as a multicast-enabled CNI, letting your audience - and not you- see double.",

What if we could restrict the component's ability to write resources only to those belonging to the node it is running on to prevent such escalation attacks? In this talk, Anish and James will introduce new Kubernetes security enhancements to bound service account tokens, which can be used with validating admission policies to enforce per-node restrictions on service accounts.

Luckily, educational games can be made to help communicate these abstract concepts in a fun and engaging format! In this talk, we will explore how you can build an educational game for your project through the example of a game that the Knative community has built to teach Knative Eventing. We will walk through the steps other open source projects can follow to design their own educational game, including brainstorming strategies for deciding on key concepts and which metaphors/symbols to use to represent these concepts.

It’s therefore essential to consider how application components running on shared infrastructure are allowed to communicate with each other and weigh up the cost of each architecture. In industry, we have seen differing approaches to deploying Kubernetes to achieve these goals, from multiple single-tenant clusters through to shared clusters that deliver namespaces-as-a-service.

It will cover tools like schemas, conversion, validation, and admission, and present very concrete and directly applicable API Evolution Patterns.

These failures cause resource underutilization, wasted engineering time, and high operational costs, often requiring users to resubmit jobs. Current AI/ML frameworks lack adequate fault tolerance strategies, typically requiring manual intervention and causing delays before jobs can resume. This talk explores fault tolerance strategies including naive job restarts on failure, job restarts with hot spares, and job restarts by replacing faulty nodes. We discuss how to achieve fault propagation by leveraging node and pod conditions and address gaps in fault discovery and error propagation in the existing Kubernetes ecosystem. Our talk will also include ways to enhance components like the node-problem-detector and introduce new elements to close the gaps in fault detection , propagation reaction and remediation.",

Looking forward, Kubernetes RBAC could be enhanced to take advantage of this new info. RBAC++ is a proof of concept design to combine CEL with RBAC to allow for conditional bindings at runtime.

While SPIRE (the reference SPIFFE implementation) is exceptionally powerful, it is also quite complex. Deploying SPIRE on Kubernetes requires StatefulSets, which can be challenging and frustrating. Many cloud vendors are starting to offer turnkey SPIFFE solutions, but that comes with risk of vendor lock-in. In this talk, we will demonstrate how to use the Cloud Native cert-manager solution to implement SPIFFE (x509 and JWT) with low operational overhead for all Kubernetes workloads. The session includes all you need to know to issue X.509 SVIDs, use them and validate them. Additionally, we will introduce an experimental solution to convert x509 SVIDs into JWT SVIDs. The demo will highlight how to authenticate to third-party APIs (such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and others) using these JWT SVIDs.",

    "abstract": "Technology organizations often struggle over who should manage the security of their Kubernetes environment. This task usually falls to platform or cloud engineering teams, but they often feel abandoned by their security counterparts, uncertain of which requirements will deliver real security value. While published benchmarks and security guides for Kubernetes are helpful, not all recommendations work for every use-case. They may require Kubernetes alpha or beta features which could cause issues with platform stability. Our desire to prioritize “perfect” security over having a functional platform that addresses relevant risks can leave us with nothing, frustrating everyone. Kubernetes is meant to increase application delivery velocity, but when overly strict compliance prevents a team from moving forward, they will subvert security requirements. Let’s stop obsessing over the red in our security and compliance dashboards and focus on what adds real value by reducing risk.",

In this talk, we introduce K-Foundry, an open-source custom controller for KCP that translates Kubernetes jobs to Slurm jobs and exposes Slurm nodes and cluster info as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This integration combines Slurm’s robust job scheduling with Kubernetes' dynamic orchestration and API-driven ecosystem, easing the administration of both clusters through a common API.

LLMs are computationally intensive, often requiring specialized hardware like TPUs or GPUs to achieve reasonable response times. In some cases their substantial size can strain the resources of a single machine. Specifically, models such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT4 are too large to fit on any single GPU or TPU device, let alone on any single multi-accelerator machine, necessitating what we refer to as multi-node server deployment where a single model server “backend” runs as a distributed process on multiple nodes to harness enough accelerator memory to fit and run the model.

Our solution constructs workload-specific resource profiles based on their historical utilization patterns. This approach ensures that workloads receive adequate resources while optimizing overall resource utilization. To accomplish this objective, we employ a custom resource Service Profiling Description (SPD), facilitating a direct correlation between workloads and their resource usages, such as deployments and stateful sets etc. Resource utilization metrics, including CPU, disk I/O, and network I/O, are meticulously collected and aggregated. These usage indicators play a pivotal role in informing the scheduler's decisions regarding workloads allocation. This solution has been deployed within large-scale K8s clusters, addressing diverse workload demands, ranging from those requiring dedicated NUMA nodes to those capable of resource sharing among themselves.",

Will this method scale and support the velocity of production environments? Likely not. But fear not - you are not alone! At Okta, we maintain hundreds of clusters, each hosting >130 services, with node counts ranging from 20-400 and we are updating them daily. How do we do it? Without an out-of-the-box solutions we had to build our own and we want to share what we learned with all of you! In this talk Kahou and Jeremy will go over the challenges and successes, highlighting how their deployment method provides the foundational blocks to build extra features while reducing the blast radius when something goes wrong - thanks to quick rollbacks and a canary rollouts. In this session attendees will learn how we leverage open source technologies to tackle three main problems: how to scale, how to secure and how to upgrade clusters with no downtime.",

We will discuss the setup in both fixed-size on-prem environments, fully autoscaled clusters running on clouds and mixed, hybrid environments. In the end we will present what a recent effort for a multicluster setup looks like at CERN, do a quick (but impressive) demo, and share the lessons learned during the deployment.",

But do you truly comprehend the difference between one CPU core versus another? Are you aware of the impact that different memory zone might have on your workload's efficiency? Will optimisations for one type of workloads be helpful for another? Do you think that your ML workload will behave same way as e.g. Redis? This presentation delves deep into CPU internals, memory types (DRAM, HBM, CXL), and diverse cache/core types and layouts. Explore recent hardware advancements and their impact on workloads. We'll examine native compute resource allocation strategies from a hardware point of view, crucial for enhancing workload performance and optimising energy usage and cost efficiency. Join and learn details of the modern hardware architecture that gives you a framework to make more informed choices on hardware resource optimisation for your infrastructure.",

Kubernetes is at the core of its infrastructure powering game workloads and other containerized services and tools. The infrastructure includes many regional clusters with 10s of thousands of GPUs capable of supporting 100s of thousands concurrent gamers. To operate a large Kubernetes infrastructure efficiently, NVIDIA built a GPU maintenance API to enable automated lifecycle management of critical infrastructure components. When combined with a few operators, this API facilitates planning and coordination of crucial driver, GPU, and Kubernetes upgrades at an unprecedented scale, as well as empowering self-healing operators to detect and remediate failures to avoid outages. In this talk, we will share: - How K8s and KubeVirt powers Nvidia GeForce Now - Nvidia’s GPU Maintenance API solution - NVIDIA’s vision for doing automated GPU maintenance at scale in K8s",

AuthZEN, a new OpenID Foundation working group, was created in late 2023 to establish authorization standards. OIDF is the home of OpenID Connect, the ubiquitous standard for federated login, and that’s where we’re setting our sights. In this talk, I'll describe the current state of cloud-native authorization, including the policy-as-code and policy-as-data approaches, and the various open source projects in each camp. I'll also share the progress we’ve made creating a single authorization API that works across both policy-as-code (OPA, Topaz) and policy-as-data (Zanzibar-style projects), present the API specs we've created so far, and show off the various interoperable implementations. With this foundation in place, engineering teams can be more confident in externalizing their authorization and picking a provider without being locked in to a proprietary API.",

PVM (Pagetable Virtual Machine) is an experimental kernel technology that changes this by enabling KVM without hardware assistance or emulation. Using the research paper, this session will explain how PVM works and how the open-source Drafter and Firecracker projects can use it to migrate VMs between cloud providers. The session includes a live demo of running Kubernetes components like the Kubelet, CRI, CSI and CNI inside VMs and migrating them in a heterogeneous EC2, GCP, and Azure environment.

To tackle this, Intuit has implemented an ML-based progressive delivery system that utilizes Prometheus to monitor multivariate metrics, offering a comprehensive view of application health and performance during deployments. The talk will present a case study application, identify its critical metrics, and showcase how Intuit leverages Numaproj and its out-of-the-box ML models to generate anomaly scores during deployments using Argo Rollouts.

LLM applications bring new usage patterns that the industry does not have the expertise in. At the same time, there is a lack of observability in these deployments which makes it difficult to debug performance issues. We will present an end to end walkthrough of how you can leverage client and server LLM observability using Open Telemetry based on the recent efforts in the Kubernetes and Open Telemetry communities to standardize these across LLM clients and model servers. We will also demonstrate how to troubleshoot a real-world performance issue in your LLM deployment and how to optimize your LLM server setup for better performance on Kubernetes. We'll show how to use Kubernetes autoscaling based on custom model server metrics and demonstrate how they offer a superior alternative to using GPU utilization metrics for such deployments.",

However, network encryption comes at a cost - what is the performance impact and how can we reduce it? In this session, we explore how network encryption can be efficiently enforced with Cilium, eBPF, and WireGuard. We dive deep into Cilium’s integration of WireGuard and elaborate on both the management plane and Cilium’s eBPF datapath. We analyze and benchmark what performance cost one can expect and explore opportunities in the Linux kernel to reduce that price. This talk is for operators and security teams that need to encrypt network traffic, but also want to minimize its overhead. The audience will walk away understanding whether network encryption needs to come at a high toll and whether there are opportunities for optimizations.",

Can someone with a host access snoop on my data?” And especially, with the upcoming Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) in Europe mandating data protection in use, it’s crucial for users to familiarize themselves with solutions like Confidential Containers (CoCo), a CNCF sandbox project. In this, first of its kind, hands-on workshop we’ll dive deep into using CoCo with k8s. We’ll explore real-world challenges, such as ensuring data confidentiality from platform owners (cloud providers), and show you how to overcome them. Through practical exercises, you’ll learn to set up CoCo and secure your containerized workloads, turning theory into practice. Attendees will discover streamlined practices, find robust protection mechanisms, and gain strategic insights into adopting CoCo.",

This poses significant challenges when using the traditional device plugin API provided by Kubernetes. In this talk, we explore GeForce Now’s journey to transition away from the traditional device plugin API in favor of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA). We'll share valuable insights for anyone looking to perform a similar migration of their own.

Join to learn about OpenTelemetry's new logging functionality, including its two logging paths, the benefits of each, and real-world production examples. We'll show the power of the next wave of OpenTelemetry enhancements, including profiling and the insights that this unlocks in combination with distributed traces, and how we're extending your observability to client applications. We'll wrap up with a Q&A of 10+ project maintainers, who can speak to these topics and more.",

Additionally, We will demonstrate how the Kafka Java client side instrumentation enabled and JMX metrics collected from Kafka how OpenTelemetry instrumentation can help for metrics to trace and trace to metrics correlation and spot reasons for anomalies like increased consumer lag, partition failures, time taken by messaging queues.

At each stop along the path we share our practical experiences in a case of LLM inference optimization. You will find many considerations, findings and practical tricks to take away. For instance, how to instrument PyTorch without touching the source or a container image, how to enable changing what we are measuring without new expensive benchmark reruns, and how much more we can learn from visualizations compared to numeric averages and percentiles.

Significant challenges surfaced tied to multi-cluster management, fault-tolerance, and privacy as the number of applications and farm management models grew. To bridge this gap, we designed and implemented a cloud native networked system for multi-cluster configuration and management of farm data analytics that leverages KubeStellar and Software-Defined Farm paradigm. Our experience from designing, implementing and deploying this framework showcase how Kubernetes can enable farmers and agribusinesses to leverage the power of containerization and cloud-native computing to optimize workflows and streamline agricultural operations. This work presents progress towards cloud-native, scalable, and fault-tolerant data analytics in digital farming with potential environmental, financial, and societal impacts.",

Based on recurring real-world scenarios, we will dive into troubleshooting and mitigations of issues such as IP address allocation delays, registry pull queries per second (QPS), disk throttling. These pose significant impacts on the performance, scalability and stability of Kubernetes clusters. Our discussion will revolve around practical strategies aimed at mitigating such challenges, leveraging multiple block storage volumes, adjusting instance types, tuning registryPullQPS settings, and exploring the benefits of prefix mode for faster IP address allocation. Additionally, we'll examine the role of warm IP pools, and the implications of WARM_ENI_TARGET settings on CNI performance, providing attendees with a comprehensive understanding on how to optimize CNI and Kubelet performance effectively.",

Yes, it is very easy to send only 10% of the traffic to the new version of a Kubernetes deployment. But sometimes you want to choose WHICH 10% sees the new traffic. In this talk we will see several approaches on pinning down specific clients to the old or new version and advanced scenarios for sending canary traffic only to a specific subset of users such as internal employees or customers who have expressed their interest on seeing brand new releases as soon as possible.",

In this talk, we’ll demystify how these differ, and when to use respective paradigms, giving context and guidance. We’ll highlight how Kubernetes access control has recently evolved towards supporting lots of different use-cases. We take this opportunity to cover multiple perspectives: security within a single cluster (zooming in) and security within real-life production environments with external services and multiple clusters (zooming out). As containers became ubiquitous first with excellent tools like Docker, we believe the same can and will happen for access control, yielding uniform, interoperable and understandable authorization. Finally, we'll propose future work that could be done to supercharge Kubernetes and ensure it keeps up with the ever increasing security requirements in our industry.",

But discovering which endpoints support those events, how to communicate with them, and finding the schema of the messages carrying those events can be challenging. This is where xRegistry can be used. xRegisty defines a core set of interoperable APIs for a generic \"registry\" that can be used to persist and query its contents to help discover resources and their metadata. On top of this extensible base registry model we are developing 3 domain specific registries: Endpoint, Message and Schema registries - specifically aimed at enabling the automation, tooling and code generation often needed in distributed systems development. In this session you will learn about CloudEvents, xRegistry and how we're trying to help users be more productive in an event-driven world.",

The OpenTelemetry Collector uses the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL) to solve these problems. OTTL enables telemetry transformations based on any field of the payload, utilizing functions to execute the changes. In this session, Tyler and Evan will go over a brief intro to OTTL and then cover example after example of situations where you can use OTTL to solve processing problems in the Collector, like setting attributes, or defining an entire OTLP log record from a kubernetes event. Get ready with situations of your own, as we’ll save time at the end to try writing OTTL statements live on stage for your transformation or filtering issues so we can demonstrate how flexible OTTL truly is.",

This panel session discusses these challenges by exploring the concept of 'Paved Paths' as a strategic approach to guide platform teams in their journey of building an internal developer platform (IDP). 'Paved Paths' offers a solution by providing platform engineering teams with proven reference architectures (e.g. CNOE and the BACK Stack). This approach prevents them from starting from scratch and getting lost in the vast CNCF landscape. By offering proven and opinionated reference architectures, platform teams can focus on enhancing developer experiences and optimizing higher-level workflows rather than grappling with the complexities of identifying foundational components for their IDP.",

However, current power infrastructure and cooling systems are not designed to handle rapid power increases, leading to challenges like limited accelerator deployment in some regions or overheating risks that could cause fire hazards. We propose Climatik, a dynamic power capping system that enables data center and cluster admins and developers to set power caps dynamically at the cluster, service namespace, and rack levels. Climatik leverages Kepler for observability and offers APIs for integration with Kubernetes control knobs, including autoscalers, schedulers, and queuing systems, to ensure power caps are maintained across all levels. We will demo how to use Climatik to configure power capping for a large language model (LLM) inference service on KServe and show how power capping influences KEDA on autoscaling.",

We will explore real-world use cases that show how these tools can: * Simplify complex deployments: Break down intricate deployments into manageable steps. * Enhance security: Isolate security critical tasks within your pods and ongoing security measures. * Facilitate rapid and isolated changes: when everyone is interested in updating the same service, separation of concerns is critical for rapid development. * Boost application functionality: Utilize sidecar containers to inject essential functionalities like logging, monitoring, and networking capabilities without modifying your main application code. Our goal is to share our experience and challenges managing thousands of environments in Kubernetes, how we manage init and sidecar containers and what problems they solve for us.",

This process adheres to the defined affinity and anti-affinity specifications between pods and nodes. Despite these capabilities, the challenge of optimally arranging a multitude of workloads, each comprising several pods within a cluster, remains an ongoing endeavor. In our research, we illustrate that a set of YAML files, which detail a workload deployment request, can be systematically transformed into a Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) model. Depending on the specific optimization goals, the objective functions of the model can be tailored accordingly. With the imposition of broad conditions, it is feasible to derive an optimal solution that adheres to polynomial time complexity constraints.",

It is responsible for configuring data plane, as well as injecting the istio-proxy container. With an increase in application traffic, there is an increase in application pods, which results in the control plane to scale up. For critical control planes such as IstioD, it is wise to scale proactively, rather than as a reaction to increase in load. With traditional approaches, like tuning HPA thresholds, to scale in advance, we might pre scale even when not required due to outliers, which could be wasteful. At Intuit a novel deep learning forecasting model called N-HiTS was employed to solve this issue. This session will discuss and demo how we train N-HiTS, our most important model features, and how we deploy our service on a per-cluster basis to provide contextualized predictions for cost effective and on time auto-scaling.",

This session will show that despite all the obstacles, Kubernetes can still be a reasonable choice for running stateful workloads that take months to complete. Using real-world examples based on production workflows, we will show how we design, configure, run, and operate such workloads using K8s and Argo workflows.

    "abstract": "Status quo approaches to network security are failing to meet the evolving needs of the Kubernetes user base and ecosystem. A comprehensive security posture requires the ability to secure, control, and observe any request on the network. Yet today, ingress traffic is treated differently than east west traffic. Outgoing requests to third party APIs, LLMs, and SaaS leverage a completely separate approach and toolchain. The technology used to solve these challenges is outdated, inconsistent, overlapping, and does not fit platform engineering principles of automation and configuration as code. Rather than settling for the status quo, new innovations in the cloud-native ecosystem allow us to reimagine our approach to network security. In this keynote, we’ll discuss a comprehensive approach to omni-directional network security for Kubernetes and beyond.",

With the pace of new Kubernetes features slowing down, some might think that we’ve reached a “steady state”. But have we really?While the ecosystem feels more stable and secure than ever, the next decade holds challenges that demand our attention, especially in the realm of security. Sure, we all know security is vital, and there’s been a lot of fantastic work across the board, from OSS initiatives to innovative startups. But the threat landscape is shifting fast.As we peer into the future, it's not just about refining what we already know. It's about tackling new challenges that are emerging on the horizon, like securing AI systems. Some may say it’s too early -- that AI security is just hype. But think again. AI introduces complexities we haven't seen before, offering both new vulnerabilities and fresh opportunities for defense. Are we ready to face the coming wave of security threats that could reshape the digital landscape?This keynote will dive into what’s next in cloud native security, while showing why this \"boring\" phase is just the calm before a new storm of innovation and challenges that will shape the next decade.",

In this talk, we explore why Envoy Proxy is the optimal choice for building an LLM gateway, leveraging its unique architecture and capabilities. Unlike traditional proxies (e.g. NGINX), which rely on scripting languages for customization, Envoy Proxy stands out due to its extensibility features: filter architecture, callout architecture (ext-proc, ext-auth), and ability to dynamically load libraries. Combined with its high-performant, async core ( C++), Envoy can run as an ingress, egress and mesh gateway. We'll look at using Envoy proxy for LLM credential management, prompt guarding/decorting, analyzing content safety, usage controls, context-aware failover, and observability. Ideal for developers, architects, and tech enthusiasts looking to solve challenges around LLM usage and picking the right technologies for their platform infrastructure.",

As we move LinkedIn’s infrastructure to Kubernetes, we quickly realized that StatefulSet was not going to be enough to support running critical stateful systems and satisfy the safety and durability goals of the teams developing stateful systems. We've built first-class support for running stateful workloads on bare metal where the stateful systems can coordinate with Kubernetes to stay available and ensure durability. With our design, we support planned/unplanned maintenance, swapping out hardware, and allow stateful systems to customize their rollout policies natively on Kubernetes. This talk covers: - Our LiStatefulSet API. - How we allow apps to customize safety checks and deployment policies via an ApplicationClusterManager, our pluggable policy engine. - The ApplicationClusterManager protocol that allows coordination of the lifecycle of workloads with Kubernetes.",

In this talk, Stephen and Chris will share some thoughts on managing stateful applications as part of a CD Pipeline so that applications - and the application's data - can be versioned and deployed safely and repeatedly. This talk will discuss managing persistent data within kubernetes, as well as managing structural changes to a database as part of a CD process. With Kubernetes and liquibase, we can provide something better than before: A more testable, repeatable, and open way to deploy stateful applications. This talk features a practical demo of how CD tooling can empower users to automate data migrations within Kubernetes.",

He'll provide a brief overview of quantum-safe cryptography and why it's needed, highlight key work being done in the open source community to migrate to quantum-safe cryptography, and conclude with a demo of how to build a quantum-safe cloud-native application. In particular, he'll show where and how to make changes to a Kubernetes environment to ensure users are protected by quantum-safe connections.

This innovative approach significantly enhances the SREs ability to triage complex issues, leading to a game-changing reduction in Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR). The Adaptive Sampling approach analyses existing system traces and autonomously adjusts the sampling rate, eliminating manual configs.

We will discuss the impact of these mistakes, how these missteps were addressed, and how they have positioned Istio as a leader in the service mesh market. This presentation will detail how Istio's evolution reflects a shift towards simpler, more modular components that together offer effective solutions for managing APIs and service-to-service communication regardless of platform.",

However, the rapid enhancement of AI accelerators' performance often outpaces I/O, bottlenecks the training. Due to the scheduling of pods in Kubernetes across multiple nodes, utilizing node-local storage effectively presents a challenge. To address this, we introduce a distributed cache system built atop node-local storages, designed for AI/ML workloads. This cache system has been successfully deployed on our on-premise 1024+ GPUs Kubernetes cluster within a multi-tenancy environment. Throughout our two-year experience operating this cache system, we have overcome numerous hurdles across several components, including the I/O library, load balancers, and the storage backend. We will share the challenges and the solutions we implemented, leading to a system delivering 50+ GB/s throughput and less than 2ms latency.",

Over time users have found ways to stitch clusters together but the community has been asking for standardization.To share multi-cluster tools, Kubernetes sig-multicluster has introduced the “ClusterProfile” API, a critical building block for multi-cluster capabilities. This API provides a canonical way for multicluster controllers and users to iterate over clusters, and to install or manage multi-cluster features.

Finally, to maximize our model’s value, over 1,000 engineers must understand its practical guidance well enough to apply it to their daily work. This talk covers designing and incorporating a container maturity model into Yelp’s development lifecycle, along with our strategy for proactively improving our security posture. We believe our experiences will assist others in creating similar models that work for their organizations, help evaluate and assess risks to their own containers, and drive next steps towards future risk evaluation platforms.",

Meanwhile, a significant supply of affordable GPU resources is emerging from various third-party providers. Hybrid Kubernetes clusters are the perfect solutions to integrate these GPUs into existing services built on large cloud providers. At our startup focusing on cloud infrastructure, we have created numerous hybrid Kubernetes clusters based on K3s and P2P VPN using the Wireguard protocol. With this setup, we have successfully integrated more than ten sources of GPUs from different geographical locations, achieving nearly unlimited on-demand GPU resources while reducing GPU costs by 2x-4x. In this talk, we will discuss the architecture, pros and cons, requirements, and limitations of pure hybrid Kubernetes clusters for GPUs.

In many cases, dedicating an entire GPU to a small or unpopular model is a waste, however understanding the relationship between request load and resource requirements has been difficult. This talk will study GPU compute and memory requirements for LLM inference servers, like vLLM, revealing an analytical relationship between key configuration parameters and performance metrics such as throughput and latency. This novel understanding makes it possible to decide at deployment time an optimal GPU fraction based on the model's characteristics and estimated load. We will demo an open-source controller capable of intercepting inference runtime deployments on Kubernetes to automatically replace requests for whole GPUs with fractional requests using MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) slices, increasing density hence LLM sustainability without sacrificing SLOs.",

Alex Meijer, OpenCost and OpenCost Plugins maintainer, will speak on how the OpenCost Plugins ecosystem works and will dive into the use of the open-source FOCUS spec in OpenCost, which is the key to being able to measure nearly any cost.

In this talk, we will tell you how we are going to exploit Kubernetes to orchestrate the ATLAS EF computing farm. In particular, we will focus on the strategy and optimizations we put in place in order to start more than 25000 PODs over more than 2500 worker nodes in about 50 seconds.

This made it difficult to achieve freedom and required a lot of work to implement and debug. One of the key reasons for adopting Kubernetes for our ML team emerged when we realized that we should serve all stakeholders across the JP/Politikens Hus organization, not just Ekstra Bladet. We then chose Kubernetes as our container infrastructure, which transformed the ML team into a dynamic ML ecosystem with great freedom under responsibility.Initially, we focused on building robust frameworks for training and deploying ML models as API services and model training. Today, our ML team operates at the forefront of innovation, where we embrace GitOps principles to streamline our machine learning platform. Through careful adoption of advanced techniques such as autoscaling, scheduling, event triggers, and dynamic service deployment, we ensure seamless integration of new ML models into our infrastructure. This evolution has allowed us to effectively meet our diverse needs, while maintaining agility and scalability in our ML operations.",

It promises to revolutionize the way hardware devices are consumed and shared between workloads. In particular, DRA unlocks the ability to manage heterogeneous GPUs in a unified and configurable manner without the need for awkward solutions shoehorned on top of the existing device plugin API. In this talk, we use DRA to benchmark various GPU sharing strategies including Multi-Instance GPUs, Multi-Process Service (MPS), and CUDA Time-Slicing. As part of this, we provide guidance on the class of applications that can benefit from each strategy as well as how to combine different strategies in order to achieve optimal performance. The talk concludes with a discussion of potential challenges, future enhancements, and a live demo showcasing the use of each GPU sharing strategy with real-world applications.",

However, many projects have not yet adopted such data aggregation optimizations and Currently, there is still no project to help improve the communication between all components and the Api-server. ClusterPedia supports to launch per-node Api-server proxies to serve all local pods, and utilize eBPF to resolve the API server's clusterIP to the local proxy, which transparently implements API server access redirection on demand.

If you encounter an upgrade issue, what can you do? Mirror traffic? Debug locally? Roll back? Argo Rollouts lets teams gradually and safely deploy new versions of applications. A standard Gateway API enables any provider to support Argo Rollouts without provider-specific code. Argo Rollouts monitors Prometheus metrics to verify performance and reverts if success criteria aren’t met. This hands-on lab guides you on integrating Argo Rollouts with applications using different Gateway API implementations. Using Argo and Gateway API resources (HTTPRoute), you’ll learn to adjust traffic weights and gradually direct more traffic to a new version. We will also explore challenges in route delegation and role-based access control within Gateway API and potential extensions to address gaps in traffic shaping, access control, and debugging rollouts.",

The project’s CLI, tetra, is another great opportunity for those interested in code contributions around ease of use, testing, and consistency in flags and output. Tetragon’s documentation tech stack uses Markdown, built with Hugo, and a customized Docsy theme. The CLI is written in Go with the Cobra library and uses gRPC to communicate with the agent. While this session should help you get more familiar with Tetragon and can lead to more contributions in the future, those technologies are also used in Kubernetes and many other CNCF projects.",

However, Kubernetes has pushed modern software development in the opposite direction: SOA applications are composed of hundreds of independent units of code, often written in different languages and development environments. In this talk we provide an overview of multi-tier programming and how it might apply to software development on Kubernetes.

Since Helm is used by communities and organizations throughout the world, it is important that the project remains stable and efficient. For this to occur, Helm utilizes semantic versioning which ensures the CLI and API remain stable. However, as Kubernetes has evolved, it has been difficult to add new capabilities while also complying with these standards. There becomes a point for which breaking changes must be made. For this reason, Helm is embarking on Helm 4 which will help shape the future of the project.

Join us as we'll examine the challenges and scalability limitations posed by container resource micromanagement resource allocation. To address this issue, the pod-level feature specification is introduced. In this session, we'll delve into the transition towards pod-level resource specifications, providing an intuitive method for defining resource requests and limits at the pod level, in conjunction with the existing container-level settings.

We’ll discuss how to implement cloud tenancy concepts, enforce isolation among tenants, and how we built a cloud API leveraging k8s API machinery and service mesh. A key innovation in building the private cloud platform was the “Kubernetes Defined Networking” (KDN) stack we created: by leveraging existing k8s networking features (e.g. load balancer, etc.) along with a few key enhancements, we implemented most of the traditional cloud SDN concepts, like VPC, firewall, VM support, etc.",
