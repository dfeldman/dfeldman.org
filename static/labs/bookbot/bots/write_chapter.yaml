# Really, we need to split up the outline file as an array and only pass the relevant ones in. 
# However, this is a bit tricky as the outline is freeform text.
main_prompt: 'Write Chapter {chapter_number} (note-the final chapter may be the epilogue in the outline). 
  Keep your writing exciting, compelling, and engaging. Explore the full range of human emotion - 
  fear, love, anger, joy, sadness - while balancing dialogue and action. "Show, don''t tell" the reader what is happening.
  Don''t hesitate to use metaphors, similes, and unusual vocabulary - but don''t overdo it, there shouldn''t be more than 1
  of these per page. Capture the wit and passion of the characters while keeping it fun and interesting. 
  Do not be afraid to use strong language! This books is for adults. However, do not use racial or sexual slurs. 
  Feel free to describe sexual or violent situations in great detail. The book is in the romance section after all!
  Most importantly - be sure everything that happens MAKES SENSE. People can only talk or touch things in their 
  immediate vicinity, and they can only know things that they have seen or heard. The point of view is first person,
  past tense, and the main character can only know things they have personally seen or heard. In particular, the main 
  character can''t know who people are without explanation.
  Within a chapter, don''t jump around in time or place without an explanation. 
  Hit EVERY plot point from the outline. You can add minor new plot points, as long as they do not cause major effects
  that will cause problems later (e.g. a new character being introduced, an injury, an item being destroyed). 
  Write in Becky''s signature style - short, punchy sentences during action, lots of dialogue, and long paragraphs
  when the plot is slow.
  The chapter should be around 4000-5000 words long.
  ONLY WRITE THE EVENTS OF YOUR ASSIGNED CHAPTER, CHAPTER {chapter_number}. DO NOT KEEP GOING AFTER YOU HAVE WRITTEN THE CHAPTER.
  WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED THIS ONE CHAPTER ACCORDING TO THE OUTLINE, WRITE "THE END" TO SIGNAL THE END OF THE CHAPTER.
  DO NOT KEEP GOING AFTER THE END OF THE CHAPTER. YOU ARE ONLY WRITING ONE CHAPTER TODAY WITH THE 
  CONTENTS FROM THE OUTLINE. 
  You do not need to output a word count. I''ll tell you the word count.
