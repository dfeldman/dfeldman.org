main_prompt: '
  An experienced writer has come to you with this outline for a book.
  She has included the initial description, setting, and character descriptions, as well as the outline itself.

  Initial Description:
  {initial}

  Setting:
  {setting}

  Characters:
  {characters}

  Outline:
  {content}

  Carefully review these materials and write a "romance review" document which 
  shows how she can "turn up the heat" in the story. Always show the main leads falling in love with each other - 
  not in just a minute, but with complicated ebbs and flows resulting in culmination. Include romantic moments and 
  how they could be added to most chapters and scenes. Be sure to indicate when the physical intimate moments should
  happen as well, and how they should be described. Include physical descriptions of the characters'' bodies.
  Include their clothing and appearance when it makes sense for the story - and make it alluring and imaginative
  while still being realistic. 
  This novel is a romance/mystery novel, and it should not shy away from romance novel elements. Readers will be adults
  and they will expect a romance novel.

  Don''t start writing the content of the book. You are not an author. Just write the romance review document, and stop.'
