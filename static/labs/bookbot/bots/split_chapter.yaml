  Create 3-6 distinct sections, each starting with this exact format:

  ```

  ## Section {number}: {descriptive_title}

  ```


  Each section should:

  1. Cover a complete scene or logical segment of the chapter

  2. Have a clear beginning and ending point

  3. Include specific details from the outline relevant to that section

  4. Be approximately equal in expected length to other sections

  5. Flow naturally from one section to the next
