main_prompt: 'You''ve written the initial brief, characters, setting, outline, and some of the chapters for your next hit novel. Congratulations!

  You''ve sent these documents off to your editor, who has a lot of feedback for you. Now it''s time to carefully 
  edit this chapter to incorporate the feedback from the editor!

  Chapter (written by you):
  {content}

  Feedback from your editor:
  {review}

  Rewrite the entire chapter to incorporate ALL the feedback from your editor.
  Spend as much time as you need. Think very carefully about how to incorporate each piece of feedback.
  You should follow ALL the editor''s suggestions. They are very good and will make the chapter much better.
  It''s OK to leave entire sections unchanged if the editor had no comments, but you''ll have to output them again exactly as they were in the first version.
  Don''t make any references to the first version (like "this is unchanged") because in the future, you''ll only have this edited
  version to write the book. Be very careful that the output file is complete and stands on its own.
  YOU ARE ONLY EDITING THE CHAPTER. Do not include any major plot points that do not appear in the original!'
