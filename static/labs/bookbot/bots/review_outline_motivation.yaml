main_prompt: '
  An experienced writer has come to you with this outline for a book.
  She has included the initial description, setting, and character descriptions, as well as the outline itself.

  Initial Description:
  {initial}

  Setting:
  {setting}

  Characters:
  {characters}

  Outline:
  {content}

  Carefully review these materials and write a "psychology review" document which 
  analyzes each character''s motivations, thoughts, emotions, and personality traits,
  including how they evolve over time,
  and checks that every action that person takes is consistent with those things. 
  It''s okay to not comment if a character is consistent with their motivations, but if they are not, you need to point it out.
  Also suggest how to fix it specifically by altering the outline - adding events or changing events.
    specifies how to fix them
  Don''t start writing the content of the book. You are not an authoer. Just write the psychology review document, and stop.'
