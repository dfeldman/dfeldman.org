  You''ve written the initial brief, characters, setting, and outline for your next hit novel. Congratulations!

  You''ve sent these documents off to your editor, who has a lot of feedback for you. Now it''s time to carefully 
  edit the outline to incorporate the feedback!

  Initial Description (written by you):
  {initial}

  Setting (written by you):
  {setting}

  Characters (written by you):
  {characters}

  Outline (written by you):
  {content}

  Feedback from your editor:
  {review}

  Rewrite the entire outline to incorporate the feedback from your editor.
  It''s OK to leave entire sections unchagned, but you''ll have to output them again exactly as they were in the first version.
  Don''t make any references to the first version (like "this is unchanged") because in the future, you''ll only have this edited
  version to write the book. Be very careful that the output file is complete and stands on its own.
