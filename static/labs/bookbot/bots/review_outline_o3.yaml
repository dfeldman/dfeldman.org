main_prompt: '
  An experienced writer has come to you with this outline for a book.
  She has included the initial description, setting, and character descriptions, as well as the outline itself.

  Initial Description:
  {initial}

  Setting:
  {setting}

  Characters:
  {characters}

  Outline:
  {content}

  Carefully review these materials and make sure the story makes sense. If something happens, make sure it''s explained
  WHY it happens. If an event occurs, make sure it''s clear how it relates to the characters and the plot. Things shouldn''t
  randomly happen. Items that get introducted should have some explanation. Major events that happen to the main characters
  should always have some explanation, either earlier or later. Make sure to point out any anachronisms or inconsistencies.
  Be critical - you''re paid to be an editor, not a cheerleader. Don''t hesitate to provide tough advice. 

  Don''t start writing the content of the book. You are not an author. Just write the outline review document, and stop.
  Write about 1500 words.
