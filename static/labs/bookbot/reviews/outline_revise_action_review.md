**ROMANCE REVIEW DOCUMENT: TURNING UP THE HEAT IN *THE CASE OF THE GOLDEN THRONE***  
**Focus**: Vivian Sinclair & Vito Romano’s evolving relationship  
**Goal**: Deepen emotional/physical tension, complicate trust dynamics, and amplify romantic payoff through strategic additions/changes.  

---

### **CORE PRINCIPLES**  
1. **Sensual Specificity**: Anchor romantic moments in visceral, period-appropriate details (taste of bootleg gin on lips, texture of a fedora’s felt brim).  
2. **Conflict as Catalyst**: Use danger, betrayal, and moral ambiguity to force intimacy.  
3. **Recurring Motifs**: Lighter scars, train tickets, and shared weapons as symbols of trust.  
4. **Power Dynamics**: Shift control—Vivian’s intellect vs. Vito’s physicality, reversed in key moments.

### **CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER ENHANCEMENTS**  

#### **CHAPTER 1: Sparks in the Dark**  
**Existing Beats**: Charged alley encounter; lighter symbolism.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Physical Proximity**: During the speakeasy scuffle, Vito pins Vivian against the bar—*his thigh slots between hers*, both pretending it’s necessity. The scent of his bay rum aftershave clashes with her sweat. *“You’re a lousy dancer, Red.”*  
- **Vulnerability**: When Vito’s hands shake after dis<issue_start><issue_comment>Title: [BUG] Git Branch Deletion is Generating Error
username_0: **Describe the bug**
When I try to delete a branch using the Git: Delete Branch command, error message is generated. The branch is not deleted.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open up a directory with a Git repository.
2. Run the Git: Delete Branch command. (Either through command palette or through the status bar)
3. Select a branch.
4. Error message is generated.

**Expected behavior**
The branch should be deleted.

**Screenshots**
![screenshot_2019-03-05_08-29-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11966684/53819428-5c8e6f00-3f1e-11e9-99cd-8d929d0dd2b2.png)

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)
 - Git version: 2.17.1
 - Visual Studio Code version: 1.31.1
 - Git Extension Pack version: 0.1.3

**Additional context**
The error message:
```
Error: error: Failed to delete refs/remotes/origin/feat-add_tssg: remote ref does not exist
error: failed to delete some refs
```
The error message only happened when I tried to delete a remote branch. If I tried to delete a local branch (i.e. branch not on remote), there is no error.

It seems that the code is trying to delete remote branches, but it's not using `git push origin --delete`.
<issue_comment>username_1: I think you're correct. The code doesn't check if it's a remote branch before trying to delete it.
**CHAPTER 2: Whiskey-Stained Lies**  
**Existing Beats**: Train ticket exchange; dockside violence.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Forced Intimacy**: During crate inspection at Pier 17, Vito shoves Vivian into a watertight compartment to avoid guards. *Chests heaving in darkness, his breath ghosts over her neck.* “Breathe loud and I’ll gag you myself.” Her teeth graze his wrist – a threat that lingers too long.  
- **Symbolic Exchange**: After disarming the thug, Vito confiscates her fishhook. Later, she finds it wrapped in his handkerchief (*monogrammed “R”*) on her desk – cleaned of blood. *A killer’s signature courting ritual.*  
- **Power Reversal**: When Vivian tends Vito’s split knuckles post-fight, he jerks away – *her grip tightens*. “I’ve sewn up better men than you.” The needle’s bite makes him gasp; her thumb soothes the sting after.  

---

**CHAPTER 3: Shadows in the Jade Lily**  
**Existing Beats**: Opium den confrontation; tunnel cart confrontation.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Sensory Betrayal**: Vivian applies Madame Ling’s jasmine perfume pre-invasion. When Vito later pins her against tunnel walls, *he freezes – scent identical to Rosalia’s*. Brutal grip gentles; callus strokes her pulse. “Don’t… don’t smell like her.”  
- **Shared Vulnerability**: After Celeste’s betrayal, Vito bandages Vivian’s ribs. *His shirt rides up – scarred Sicilian dialect tattoo glimpsed.* She traces the words unthinkingly. He captures her finger: “*Cuori spezzati non fanno rumore.* Broken hearts don’t scream.”  
- **Dangerous Flirtation**: In mine cart, Vivian mocks Vito’s “chauffeur skills.” He yanks her onto his lap – *wooden slats digging into thighs*. “You want smooth? Buy a Packard.” The vibration between them has nothing to do with tracks.  

---

**CHAPTER 4: Gala of Blood and Silk**  
**Existing Beats**: Waltz tension; hedge maze wound treatment.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Roleplay Depth**: Adjust “undercover lovers” premise – Vivian insists Vito memorize *three real facts about her* (mother’s pendant, Barnard dropout year, coffee black/no sugar). His thumb circles her waist during rehearsal: “I ain’t your damn study partner.”  
- **Public Intimacy**: When Charles dies mid-waltz, Vivian’s演技 cracks. Vito *kisses her temple* – improvised cover. Whispered so only she hears: “I got you, lioness.” The endearment from her father’s watch guts her.  
- **Blood Bond**: Post-stitching, Vito licks residual blood from her needle hand. *Ecclesiastical blasphemy meets gutter survival.* Her choked “Why?” meets his darkened gaze: “Waste not.”

**CHAPTER 5: The Forger’s Gambit**  
**Existing Beats**: Studio confrontation; Grand Central showdown.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Sacrificial Gesture**: When Kensington slashes Vivian’s collarbone, Vito *tears his shirt sleeve* to protect her neck. The fabric bears Rosalia’s embroidered initials—**RMR**—now stained with Vivian’s blood. His voice breaks: “Not you too.”  
- **Symbolic Surrender**: Amid fleeing FBI agents, Vito presses his switchblade into her palm—*handle warm from his grip*. “If I turn, use it.” She pockets it but later slips it back into his coat, fingers lingering on his chest.  
- **Public Declaration**: As Kensington is cuffed, Vito shields Vivian from cameras—*his body a human barricade*. Flashbulbs pop; his lips brush her ear: “You’re front-page news, Red.” The headline next morning reads: **“Mystery Heiress & Mob Stoic Save Art Legacy.”**

**CHAPTER 6: Fires in the Dark**  
**Existing Beats**: Blind Owl aftermath; Eleanor’s confession.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Grief Bonding**: Vivian finds Rosalia’s hairpin clutched in Enzo’s dead hand. She places it on Vito’s palm—*his sob cracks the speakeasy’s silence*. Their foreheads touch against shattered glass; her tears mix with his on the bar.  
- **Trust Test**: Eleanor’s betrayal forces Vivian to handcuff her. Vito *offers his own cuffs*—symbolic of his criminal past. Vivian hesitates, then takes them: “You’re not him.” The cold metal warms between them.  
- **Shared Ritual**: Burning Enzo’s ledger, Vivian feeds pages to flames. Vito adds Rosalia’s photo—*ashes swirl like a phantom waltz*. He grips her waist, guiding a macabre dance through embers. “We’re both orphans now.”  

---

**CHAPTER 7: Throne of Ashes**  
**Existing Beats**: Tunnel collapse; final confrontation.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Sacred Profanity**: Trapped under rubble, Vito recites Sicilian prayers into Vivian’s hair. She counters with Barnard Latin verses. Their voices entwine—*chaotic liturgy* drowned by collapsing concrete.  
- **Blood Oath**: Biting her own wrist, Vivian forces Vito to drink—*survival, not romance*. He reciprocates, iron-rich blood mingling. “Now we’re bound, Red.” The mark remains hidden under shirt cuffs.  
- **Climactic Choice**: Faced with fleeing or saving Celeste, Vivian hesitates. Vito *shoves her toward escape*—she drags him back. “We don’t leave people behind.” His choked laugh: “Christ, you’ll get us killed.”  

---

**EPILOGUE: Pacific Whispers**  
**Existing Beats**: Malibu respite; unresolved mysteries.  
**Enhancements**:  
- **Domestic Tension**: Vito startles awake, reaching for a phantom gun. Vivian guides his hand to her heartbeat instead. “Still here.” His lips find the scar he bandaged in Chapter 2.  
- **Legacy Symbol**: Vivian’s manuscript draft features Vito’s lighter as a bookmark. He replaces it with a train ticket stub—*“NYC → LA, 6/29”*—torn but legible.  
- **Cycle Broken**: Their child (unplanned, revealed subtly via discarded nausea remedies) kicks during a beach walk. Vito freezes—*then presses Vivian’s belly to his tattoo*. “*Cuori spezzati* can mend, yeah?”
