**Plot Hole Review Document for *The Case of the Golden Throne***  

---

### **1. Chapter 1: Vito’s Unexplained Presence at the Museum**  
**Issue**: Vito appears abruptly in the museum scene with no setup for how he knew Vivian would be there.  
**Fix**:  
- Add a line in *Chapter 1, Scene 1* where Vivian notices a shadowy figure tailing her earlier in the day while investigating the museum.  
- In *Chapter 1, Scene 3* (speakeasy), include dialogue where Vito admits Enzo ordered him to “scare her off” the case after noticing her poking around the museum.  
**Result**: Establishes Vito’s surveillance and motives, avoiding a deus ex machina entrance.

### **2. Celeste’s Paint Foreshadowing**  
**Issue**: Celeste’s paint-stained hands in the museum (*Chapter 1*) aren’t linked to her later role as a forger.  
**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 1, Scene 1*, when Celeste spills paint, specify the shade as *Prussian blue* and mention Vivian pockets a fleck of dried paint.  
- Later, in *Chapter 3, Scene 1* (brothel), show Vivian recognizing the same paint under Celeste’s nails when they meet again.  
**Result**: Creates a visual through-line connecting Celeste’s early appearance to her forgery work.  

---

### **3. Retinal Scanner Anachronism**  
**Issue**: The retinal scanner in the tunnel vault (*Chapter 7*) is historically implausible for 1929.  
**Fix**:  
- Replace the retinal scanner with a **mechanical combination lock** based on the Roman numeral XVII (referencing Gallery 17).  
- Foreshadow this in *Chapter 1*: When Vivian traces her father’s initials, note the numeral XVII carved into the throne’s base.  
**Result**: Period-appropriate security with setup and payoff.  

---

### **4. Freddie’s Train Ticket Knowledge**  
**Issue**: Freddie slips Vivian a train ticket in *Chapter 1* with no setup for how he knows she’ll need it.  
**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 1, Scene 2* (newsroom), add a line where Freddie overhears Fletcher berating Vivian about “wasting time on the Long Island case.”  
- Have Freddie smirk and say, “I’ve got a sixth sense for trouble, Red—and you’re headed straight for it.”  
**Result**: Links Freddie’s actions to his eavesdropping and establishes his role as an informant.  

---

### **5. Eleanor’s Sudden Betrayal**

- In *Chapter 4*, show Eleanor hesitating before handing Vivian a decoded message, her hands trembling.  
**Result**: Subtly hints at financial desperation and moral conflict.  

---

### **6. Travel Logic Between Locations**  
**Issue**: Transitions between settings (e.g., museum to speakeasy) lack transportation details.  
**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 1, Scene 3*, add a beat after the museum fight: Vivian “hails a cab, the driver side-eyeing her bloody stocking,” and specify a 15-minute ride to Mulberry Street.  
- In *Chapter 2, Scene 2* (Pier 17), note that Vito “drives them in a borrowed Ford Model A, headlights off to avoid patrols.”  
**Result**: Grounds the narrative in realistic movement.  

---

### **7. Celeste’s Daughter Introduction**  
**Issue**: The daughter’s sudden appearance in *Chapter 5* feels unearned.  
**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 3, Scene 1* (brothel), include a fleeting image of a child’s drawing (signed “C.M.”) pinned to Celeste’s desk.  
- In *Chapter 4*, when Celeste gives Vivian the key, have her glance at a locket with the girl’s photo.  
**Result**: Builds emotional stakes for Celeste’s actions.

### **9. Charles Beaumont’s Pocket Watch**  
**Issue**: The stopped watch as a clue (*Chapter 3*) isn’t foreshadowed.  
**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 1, Scene 2* (newsroom), have Freddie toy with his own pocket watch, noting, “Time’s the only thing that never lies, Red.”  
- During the gala in *Chapter 4*, specify Charles checking his watch nervously before his death.  
**Result**: Establishes timepieces as thematic elements.  

---

### **10. Tunnel Mine Cart Realism**  
**Issue**: Electrified mine carts in 1929 tunnels stretch plausibility.  
**Fix**:  
- Change to **hand-pumped rail carts** (common in early 20th-century mining).  
- In *Chapter 3, Scene 2*, describe Vito “grunting as he pumps the lever, muscles straining against rusted gears.”

- In *Chapter 6*, have Fletcher discuss Vivian with Eleanor: “She’s got her father’s stubbornness—and my sister’s eyes.”  
**Result**: Clarifies his emotional investment.  

---

### **13. The Golden Throne’s Authenticity**  
**Issue**: The throne’s sudden appearance in the crate (*Chapter 7*) needs earlier setup.  
**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 1, Scene 1*, specify that the replica’s dimensions don’t match museum records. Vivian notes, “The arms are too narrow—this isn’t the real throne.”  
- In *Chapter 3*, have Celeste reference “a throne too heavy to move” in the tunnels.  
**Result**: Pays off the replica discrepancy.  

---

**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 4, Scene 1* (gala), include a mayoral speech where Kensington declares, “New York’s future lies in its *cultural treasures*,” with a cut to thugs loading crates below.  
**Result**: Links his public persona to criminal activity.  

---

### **17. Final Showdown Logistics**  
**Issue**: The FBI’s arrival at Grand Central (*Chapter 5*) isn’t coordinated with Vivian’s actions.

**Result**: Explains how authorities know where to go.  

---

### **18. Vito’s Sister’s Backstory**

**Fix**:  
- In *Chapter 3, Scene 2* (tunnels), add a flashback where Vito recalls Rosalia’s voice singing *O Sole Mio* as he pumps the cart.  
**Result**: Deepens his motivation for opposing Enzo.  

---

### **19. Period-Inappropriate Language**  
**Issue**: Terms like “retinal scanner” and “Madame X” feel anachronistic.  
**Fix**:

- In *Chapter 4, Scene 2* (hedge maze), have Vito confide, “I didn’t run because… I couldn’t leave *you* here.”  
**Result**: Builds emotional intimacy.
