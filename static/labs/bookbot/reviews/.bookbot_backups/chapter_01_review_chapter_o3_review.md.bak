Below are editorial notes on Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows. I’ll list specific issues and suggestions by section and then overall remarks. (This is Chunk 1; I will continue afterward.)

─────────────────────────────  
Museum Gallery Scene

• Memory and Mood:  
 – The opening description (“linseed oil and wet stone… decay and desperation”) powerfully sets a noir tone. However, the imagery sometimes overloads the reader. Consider toning down some metaphors (for instance, “jewel-toned shadows” and “the scar on the pedestal’s edge still held traces of Old Spice”) so that the sensory detail supports clarity without overwhelming the narrative voice.  
 – The personal connection (“Before they blamed my father”) is intriguing but feels abrupt. Clarify, even in a brief internal aside, why this legacy matters here and how it ties to her present investigation.

• Character Introductions and POV Consistency:  
 – Guard Joe is introduced minimally (“Joe—the nameplate said Joe”) and his dialogue (“Upgrades. They replaced the cameras with papier-mâché doves”) is a good dose of dark humor. Still, consider ensuring his brief presence is uniform with a working character rather than an afterthought.  
 – As the scene shifts quickly from internal observation to action (“A shadow rippled…” and then a sudden blade attack), the first-person POV maintains immediacy but occasionally splinters into fragments. A few smoothing transitions might help the reader follow the physical details without losing Vivian’s internal urgency.

• Action and Weapon Use:  
 – Vivian grabbing “an iron candelabra” is visually striking, but the logic of having a museum candelabra within immediate reach might benefit from a short internal justification (“I’d seen them set out for display” or a brief moment of impulse).  
 – When the blade “sliced through my skirt” and blood is described pooling on the mosaic, the sequence is vivid. However, consider clarifying the timing—are the injuries instantaneous enough for her pain and reaction to overlap naturally? A moment’s pause in the narrative could reinforce the impact without feeling rushed.

• Introducing Celeste Moreau:  
 – Celeste’s sudden attack (“revealing a man in a moth-eaten docent’s uniform… Celeste Moreau, Restoration Specialist”) is interesting but feels brief. Her motives seem conflicted: early on she assaults Vivian, only to later deliver a cryptic message (“Tell Enzo the throne stays lost”) that hints at hidden loyalties.  
  • Suggest adding a subtle internal note or a quick clarifier so the reader isn’t left wondering whether Celeste is an enemy, reluctant ally, or double-crossing agent.  
  • Ensure that her later actions (reappearing and accusing someone of framing “my father”) line up with her backstory as an art forger caught between Kensington’s demands and personal loyalties.

Newsroom Section

• Tone Shift and Dialogue:  
 – The transition from violent chaos in the gallery to the *Daily Sentinel*’s newsroom is abrupt but effective in contrasting worlds. Still, the dialogue (Fletcher’s “You’re not Woodward, kid. Drop the tombstone raiding.”) could be polished for consistency—Fletcher should sound gruff while still being a mentor figure.  
 – When his hand slams down on the return key and ash flakes over Vivian’s notes, consider a more measured description that still captures his brusque style. The symbolism (the glove that bursts into flames under his Zippo) is striking but borders on the surreal; deciding whether it is literal or symbolic may help avoid distraction from the plot’s logic.

• Clarifying Clues and Internal Consistency:  
 – Eleanor’s brief appearance with the note (“Midnight. Don’t be late. —V”) is a key beat from the outline. It might help to have an internal comment from Vivian linking the “blue” clue (via the earlier paint-spill hint) to these instructions.  
 – The brief mention of “prussian blue” on the dropped glove and the subsequent note should more clearly tie to Dad’s case files. A brief internal connection in her thoughts could ensure the reader sees this as an intentional clue rather than a random non sequitur.

─────────────────────────────  
Blind Owl and Docks Scenes

• Wound Treatment and Character Interaction:  
 – In the Blind Owl setting, Vito’s attempt at tending Vivian’s wound—with his trembling fingers and the later dialogue (“Temporary alignment. And Rosa?”)—is nicely atmospheric, but his motivation and internal conflict come through only in snippets. Emphasize his guarded tone through subtle internal narration to reinforce his “tough but caring” persona, so his later revelations (about his sister’s death) feel earned rather than casual throwaway lines.  
 – When Vito instructs, “You’ve got thirty seconds before the cops arrive. Run now…” it’s effective in peppering urgency. Just be sure that the physicality (grabbing lapels, his thumb on her throat as he shoves her) remains consistent with both characters’ established personalities.

• Scene Transitions at the Docks:  
 – The docks scene is frenetic—bullets, rapid action (“Left side, Red! Go!”) and time markers (11:52, 11:59, etc.) lend a ticking-clock tension. However, these time stamps, though evocative, might disorient the reader if given too much weight. Consider integrating them more fluidly into Vivian’s internal thought process rather than as a series of stamped alerts.  
 – The introduction of the trawler named *SS Rosa* and the subsequent mix-up with Enzo’s identity (along with Vito’s remark, “The idiot’s using my sister’s boat”) is clever but again relies on the reader catching every detail. Perhaps a brief internal recollection that links the boat’s name to Vito’s backstory would help reinforce the connection without lengthy exposition.

• Final Sequence and Clues for the Next Move:  
 – The coded message revealed on the waterlogged painting (*IX-XVII-XXIX*) and the conversation about Kensington’s anniversary gala strongly nail down the plot’s next step. However, the transition from chaos to strategy (“We need his eyeball or a damn good replica” and then learning “The throne’s been Kensington’s all along”) might benefit from a quick internal breather—a moment of reflection from Vivian that bridges the physical adrenaline with her investigative mindset.  
 – The dialogue about “getting dressed for the gala” (the sequined flapper gown tossed her way) is in keeping with the high-stakes world. Still, ensure that the tone of banter here is consistent with her internal voice—a mix of vulnerability, anger, and determination.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Structure and Style

• Pacing and Sentence Structure:  
 – The chapter is densely packed with action, dialogue, and clues. While this fits a noir, fast-paced style, some transitions feel abrupt. Consider using brief internal asides to ground the reader between high-adrenaline sequences.  
 – Some sentences especially in action sequences could be trimmed for clarity. For instance, reworking excessively long sentences that string multiple sensory details together might preserve both atmosphere and readability.

• Vocabulary and Metaphor Overload:  
 – While your vocabulary is strong and evocative, be cautious not to overwhelm the reader. In several places (e.g., “the mosaic floor pooling between Justinian’s stone eyes” and “the watch ticked louder than my racing heart”), less could be more. Aim for vivid but precise language that conveys the moment without devolving into overwrought imagery.

• Logical Coherence and Character Motivation:  
 – A few plot details (like Celeste’s shifting role and the gaps in why certain characters suddenly appear and then vanish) need to be flagged. Make sure that every entrance/exit of a character, especially in scenes where violence or betrayal occurs, is foreshadowed or internally explained—at least via brief thoughts from Vivian.
 – Ensure that Vivian’s internal logic as a dedicated reporter remains consistent. Her shock and pain are well done, yet her decision-making sometimes feels impulsive. Even in urgency, a reflective moment of “this is how I solve cases” could reinforce her credibility.

I’ll continue with further notes on dialogue consistency and final suggestions in Chunk 2.
