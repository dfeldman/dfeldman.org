Below are my detailed editorial notes for Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows. This first chunk focuses on overall structure, characterization, pacing, and style.

1. Atmosphere & Worldbuilding:
 • The opening description does an excellent job setting a moody, vibrant 1929 Manhattan gallery. Your sensory details (sunlight fracturing through stained glass, heavy scents of linseed oil and old stone) immerse the reader. However, sometimes the language can feel overly decorative—consider paring back a few adjectives so that each vivid image has extra punch.
 • The depiction of the museum—with the empty pedestal and crude papier‑mâché replacement—works well as a visual metaphor. Just be sure that later clues (the father’s carved initials and familiar scent) aren’t lost in too many similar details. Balance is key.

2. Scene Transitions & Pacing: 
 • You cover three distinct locales in one chapter: the museum, the Daily Sentinel newsroom, and the Blind Owl speakeasy. The timeline (10:00 AM, 2:30 PM, and midnight) is clear and consistent. That said, a few more connective sentences during transitions (for example, clarifying how events in the museum lead directly into her newsroom routine) could help the reader follow the passage of time more seamlessly.
 • The shift from the emotionally charged museum attack to the frenetic work environment at the Sentinel is effective, though you might consider smoothing over the transition slightly. For instance, brief internal commentary that ties her physical pain to her determination can link the personal to the professional more naturally.

3. Clues & Plot Setup:
 • Every key clue from your outline is present: the father’s initials, the signature scent (Old Spice/sandalwood/gun oil), Vito’s silver lighter inscribed “Rosa,” Celeste’s “accidental” spill of Prussian blue paint (mirroring the tunnel maps), the note from Eleanor (“Follow the blue. —Madame X”), and the train ticket reading “Midnight. Don’t be late. —V,” followed by the manifest at the Blind Owl. This creates a cohesive mystery trail.
 • One caution is the reference to “Old Spice.” Given this is set in 1929, double-check that it doesn’t read as a modern trademark anachronism. If necessary, opt for a period-appropriate fragrance or a generic description (e.g. “a classic, old-world cologne”).
 • The manifest and train ticket clues are introduced in a clear, matter-of‑fact style befitting an investigative noir. Just ensure that future chapters definitively link these clues so that readers feel rewarded for their attention.

4. Characterization & Dialogue:
 • The use of the first-person POV keeps the narrative intimate. The protagonist’s observations help define her as determined and meticulous, which is excellent. Still, be cautious not to let exposition become “telling” rather than “showing”—for example, when you note, “I was now entangled in a mystery…” you might let her actions speak to that realization.
 • Vito’s entrance is memorable (“Curiosity kills, Red”) and immediately ties his character into her world. His cool, efficient manner in treating her injury further builds his image as a rugged, resourceful man. In a few spots (for instance, the subtle moment when her skirt rides up and his breath catches), review to ensure these details support his complexity without overwhelming the storyline.
 • Fletcher’s abrupt interference (grabbing the draft and burning it in the sink) reinforces the hard-edged newsroom setting. To enhance believability, consider whether a sink is the most historically plausible tool for disposing of documents—or if a quick flash of a lighter might work better in a bustling office.
 • Eleanor’s slip of a note (“Follow the blue. —Madame X”) is both mysterious and effective. It also smartly screens her character as someone who operates in secret. Just confirm that her quiet entrance and subtle clues remain consistent with her established personality throughout the narrative.

5. Tone & Style:
 • Your vivid and detailed literary style is a strong suit—it evokes the noir atmosphere superbly. Just keep an eye on repetitive imagery; for instance, several passages stressing physical sensations may benefit from slight trimming to maintain a brisk narrative pace.
 • The chapter’s stylistic choices serve to heighten the stakes. Nonetheless, if the reader occasionally feels overwhelmed by sensory overload, consider interspersing moments of leaner prose or sharper internal reflection to give the prose room to breathe.

6. Plot & Logical Coherence:
 • All major plot beats outlined for this chapter appear present. The clues come in logical succession, and the narrative stakes are immediately clear: a connection between the art heist, her father’s past, and an emerging criminal network.  
 • One review point: The violent altercation in the Blind Owl (where a drunken man gropes her and Vito intervenes with a bottle) is effective in ratcheting up the tension. Just ensure that the treatment of this assault respects the protagonist’s agency and is integrated into her investigation without becoming gratuitous. Balancing shock value with character strength is key.

This concludes the first set of editorial notes. I’ll now provide additional, more focused observations on structure and minor tweaks in the next chunk.
