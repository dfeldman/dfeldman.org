Review of "The Case of the Golden Throne" Outline

The overall structure of this noir mystery/romance appears solid, with clear character motivations and a well-developed plot. However, there are several areas that require attention to ensure logical progression and proper setup/payoff of key elements.

Major Plot Elements Requiring Clarification:

1. The Golden Throne
- The outline needs to establish earlier what makes this artifact significant
- Its value and historical importance should be mentioned in Chapter 1
- The connection between the throne and Kensington's ego needs more development
- Consider explaining why it's called "golden" if it has emeralds

2. The 1926 Museum Heist
- Need clearer connection between Vivian's father's death and the heist
- Outline should specify whether he was killed during the heist or after
- His role as a security guard needs more detail about his duties/access
- The timing between his death and Vivian's investigation needs clarification

3. The Tunnel Network
- The technology level (retinal scanners in 1929) needs justification
- Explain how such an extensive tunnel system was built without notice
- Clarify who maintains/operates the mine cart system
- Need explanation of how art is moved without being damaged

Character Motivation Issues:

1. Vivian Sinclair
