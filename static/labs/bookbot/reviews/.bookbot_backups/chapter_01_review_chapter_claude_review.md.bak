Here are my editorial notes for Chapter 1 of "The Case of the Golden Throne":

STRUCTURAL ISSUES:
- The chapter opens in medias res without properly introducing Vivian or establishing her motivations. We need a brief paragraph showing why she's at the museum and what she hopes to find.
- The timeline jumps confusingly between scenes. Add clear transitions and time markers.
- Several characters appear without introduction or context (Guard Joe, Celeste, Vito). Need to establish who they are when they first appear.
- The romance between Vivian and Vito escalates too quickly without proper development of trust/attraction.

PLOT HOLES & LOGIC ISSUES:
- How did Vivian get access to the crime scene? Need to show her press credentials.
- Why doesn't Guard Joe stop her from touching evidence?
- The knife attacker's identity is never revealed - this thread is left dangling.
- How does Vivian know about the tunnels under City Hall? Need setup.
- Why does Vito help her so readily? His motivations are unclear.
- The train ticket appears magically in her typewriter with no explanation of how it got there.
- Characters move between locations without explaining how they traveled.

CHARACTERIZATION:
- Vivian's voice needs more consistency - sometimes hardboiled, sometimes naive.
- Her emotional reaction to mentions of her father needs more depth.
- Vito's character feels tropey - needs more unique personality traits.
- Supporting characters (Sammy, Eleanor) need more distinct voices.

SETTING & ATMOSPHERE:
- Good period details but some anachronisms ("sucker punch", modern police codes).
- Need more sensory details about the museum and speakeasy.
- Weather and time of day often unclear.
- City geography needs better establishment.

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:
1. Open with Vivian arriving at museum, showing her credentials and explaining her purpose.
2. Add a scene showing how she got the museum access.
3. Develop Vito's introduction more gradually before the knife scene.
4. Explain how characters travel between locations.
5. Add more emotional depth to father references.
6. Fix anachronistic language.
7. Clarify timeline between scenes.
8. Add weather and lighting details.
9. Show how train ticket appears.
10. Resolve knife attacker identity.

STYLE:
- Overuse of similes ("like a sucker punch", "like bones in a shallow grave")
- Some purple prose needs toning down
- Dialogue occasionally feels modern rather than period-appropriate
- Action scenes need clearer choreography

PACING:
- The opening scene moves too quickly
- Middle section drags with too much dialogue
- Final scenes feel rushed

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
The chapter has strong noir atmosphere and compelling central mystery, but needs structural work and better character development. Focus on establishing clear motivations and logical story progression while maintaining the atmospheric strengths.
