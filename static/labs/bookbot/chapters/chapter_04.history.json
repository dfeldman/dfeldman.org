Its theft in 1926 left a scar on the museum\u2014and Vivian\u2019s family (her uncle was the disgraced night guard).  \n- **Mine-Cart Network**: A web of pre-Civil War tunnels retrofitted with electric rails.

Neon signs flicker above pawnshops; headlines scream about gangland shootings and soaring stocks.  \n- **Tension**: The humidity feels like a held breath. Every interaction carries subtext\u2014flirtation laced with danger, offers of help that could be traps.  \n- **Eroticism**: Lingering touches in crowded speakeasies, the slide of silk stockings, whispered secrets in dark corners.

I counted twelve moldering mattresses in the tenement\u2019s foyer, springs curled like fossilized ribcages. The address from Rex\u2019s matchbook leered in peeling gilt numbers above a door boarded with nails rusted to sepia tears. My flashlight beam sliced through grime-coated air. Blood spatter clung to the walls, old as sin. \u201cNowhere to go but down,\u201d I whispered to Arthur\u2019s ghost. He\u2019d preferred attics. The coal chute crouched behind a cairn of firebricks, its iron hinges shrieking betrayal. I slid into the void, knees scraping through a century of soot. My blouse caught on a nail, tearing free with the sound of a violinist\u2019s last breath. Greenish light flickered below. The tunnels stank of wet earth and ozone. Narrow-gauge tracks gleamed under bare bulbs strung like witchlights. I pressed against a sweating brick pillar as voices echoed. \u201c\u2026Thursday\u2019s shipment,\u201d growled a sandpapered baritone. \u201cThrone goes to the docks, same as the Rembrandt.\u201d  \n\nA younger voice: \u201cWho\u2019s moving it?\u201d  \n\n\u201cSame bastards who shut Lowell\u2019s trap permanent.\u201d Ragged laughter. \u201cBoss don\u2019t care if we sail it or sink it, long as the mayor gets paid.\u201d  \n\n*Mayor.* My pulse thrummed. The flashlight slipped in my clammy grip. A distant train horn drowned their retreating footsteps. Silence rushed in, thick as clotting blood. My beam trembled over tracks, then caught on something pale. A hand. The subway worker lay sprawled like a broken marionette, left arm twisted behind him, right fist clenched. I pried open his rigor-mortis fingers. A slip of paper\u2014*Grand Central. Thursday, 11:15 PM. Track B-12.*  \n\nHis throat grinned sideways. Gin surged up my own. I retched into the coal dust. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\n**\u201cI\u2019ve been threatened by better,\u201d** I lied. Fletcher\u2019s pencil snapped. Gold whiskey trembled on his mustache. \u201cThey mentioned your uncle. Said if I didn\u2019t bury this story, they\u2019d send Arthur a playmate.\u201d  \n\nThe *Star*\u2019s newsroom buzzed behind us, telewriters clattering like distant artillery. \u201cYou\u2019re off the case.\u201d His ink-stained fingers drummed a Morse code of fear. I slapped the train schedule on his desk. Blood smeared the page. \u201cTell that to the corpse in the tunnels.\u201d  \n\nHe didn\u2019t look up. \u201cFuneral\u2019s Friday. Bring lilies.\u201d  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nRain lashed the library\u2019s leaded windows. Eleanor Brooks emerged from the stacks, a cameo brooch pinned at her throat like a preserved scar. \u201cTunnels, you say?\u201d She unrolled a yellowed map, her voice as dry as the parchment. \u201cBuilt for coal in \u201958. Retrofitted during Prohibition.\u201d Her nail traced a spiderweb beneath Fifth Avenue. \u201cSmugglers use them to bypass checkpoints.\u201d  \n\nI pointed to Delancey Street. \u201cWhere does this spur lead?\u201d  \n\n\u201cDocks.\u201d She folded the map with surgical precision. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t hear that from me.\u201d  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nMy apartment reeked of betrayal. I tossed the schedule onto the desk, poured two fingers of bathtub gin, and froze. Shadows moved. \u201cLate for a social call, isn\u2019t it?\u201d My Derringer found the darkness. Vito stepped into the jaundiced glow of my desk lamp. Rain glistened on his shoulders. \u201cYou missed the memo, doll. Warrens are Moretti turf.\u201d  \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the penalty for trespassing these days?\u201d  \n\nHe plucked the glass from my hand, swallowed the gin in one motion. \u201cDepends. You hoping for a spanking or a bullet?\u201d  \n\nSandalwood cut through the mildew. Closer now. \u201cYou\u2019re tracking mud on my last clean rug.\u201d  \n\nHe stepped over the stain. \u201cThat corpse in the tunnels? He worked for *my* crew. You\u2019re costing me money.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSend me a bill.\u201d  \n\nHis fingers brushed the silver streak in my hair. \u201cOr a wreath?\u201d  \n\nThe kiss landed like a sucker punch\u2014hot, brutal, gone before I could bite. He was at the door when I threw the glass. It shattered against the jamb. \u201cYou taste like secrets,\u201d he said, and vanished into the stairwell. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nThe train schedule glowed under my lamp. 11:15 PM. Compartment B-12. Arthur\u2019s pocket watch ticked on my wrist. I lit a cigarette with hands that wouldn\u2019t steady. Somewhere below, the third-floor neighbor\u2019s radio crooned: *\u201c\u2026the golden chair, the golden chair, the gangster\u2019s sweet affair\u2026\u201d*  \n\nI traced the dead man\u2019s bloodstains. Gus the night guard had mentioned strange noises in the museum basement. Coal chutes. Corpses. Compartments. The typewriter keys laughed under my fingers.\n\nWrite the chapter in engaging prose. End with \"THE END\".",
    "content": "**# Chapter 4: Society\u2019s Sharp Edges**  \n\nThe ballroom stank of gardenias and greed. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto acres of sequined spite, each gown costlier than a tenement\u2019s yearly rent. I adjusted my borrowed pearls\u2014paste replicas that chafed like the lie they were\u2014and wove through champagne tides. Lydia Fitzgerald awaited me by the grand piano, her ice-blonde chignon sharp enough to slit throats.  \n\n\u201cDarling!\u201d She air-kissed my cheek, her breath sweet with vermouth. \u201cYou simply must try the *canap\u00e9s*. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is *divine*\u2014I hear they liquored up the geese before slaughter.\u201d Her fingernails bit into my wrist as she leaned closer. \u201cSecond button\u2019s loose on your glove. Amateurs always miss the details.\u201d  \n\nThe piano launched into a jaunty Cole Porter. A waiter glided past; I snagged two coupes of champagne. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I\u2019d come?\u201d  \n\nLydia\u2019s smile was a scalpel. \u201cBecause your press pass tears crookedly, dear. The *Star* doesn\u2019t starch its collars.\u201d She sipped, leaving a crimson half-moon on the glass. \u201cAlso, Fletcher owes me a favor. Something involving a Senator\u2019s *indiscretion* and a borzoi.\u201d  \n\nA marble-columned mirror caught our reflection: we could\u2019ve been sisters, if despair were a shade of lipstick. She saw me notice. \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s wife had that installed. She likes to watch her guests stab backs mid-waltz.\u201d  \n\nI deposited my empty flute on a passing tray. \u201cWhy help me?\u201d  \n\n\u201cKensington called my father\u2019s suicide a \u2018tax dodge\u2019 at the Darby Ball.\u201d Her thumb grazed the cameo at her throat\u2014real, unlike mine. \u201cNow. Three o\u2019clock. Freddie Winslow\u2019s about to disgrace himself by the potted ivy.\u201d  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nFreddie swayed like a metronome set to *disaster*. Monocle fogged, ascot askew, he clutched a magnum of Dom P\u00e9rignon like a newborn. \u201cVivi! Vivace! *Vixen!*\u201d Champagne sloshed onto my T-straps as he engulfed me. \u201cHeard you\u2019re hunting ghosts! Did\u2019ya know the mayor\u2019s got a *pet*? Choo-choos to *nowhere*, fulla\u2019 *art* or some rot!\u201d  \n\nI steadied him. \u201cSlow down, Freddie. Which nowhere?\u201d  \n\n\u201cWhitefields!\u201d He hiccuped. \u201cBut the throne\u2019s not there. Lost luggage. Or legs? Leggy legs\u2014\u201d His gaze snagged on a waiter\u2019s tight trousers. I yanked his chin back.  \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the next train?\u201d  \n\n\u201cThursday.\u201d His hand found my waist. \u201cRide with me, Viv. I\u2019ll show you the *compartments*\u2014\u201d  \n\nThe chandelier dimmed. Across the room, Enzo Moretti\u2019s pockmarked face glowed in match-light as he lit a cigar. Two gorillas in tuxedos flanked him, necks thicker than their skulls.  \n\nVito materialized at my elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re lost, doll. Kitten\u2019s pen\u2019s upstairs.\u201d He gripped my arm, silk sleeve sliding over taut muscle.  \n\nFreddie sneered. \u201cPiss off, greaseball.\u201d  \n\nVito headbutted him. Freddie folded into the ivy, snoring.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nThe closet smelled of mothballs and murder. Vito shoved me inside, one palm clamped over my mouth. His thumb brushed my lower lip. \u201cYell and I\u2019ll gag you proper.\u201d  \n\nShoes clattered past the door. \u201c\u2026check the terrace,\u201d snarled a voice like gravel in a meat grinder. \u201cBoss wants the snoop gutted.\u201d  \n\nVito\u2019s body pinned mine against brooms. Sandalwood and gunpowder. Heat radiated through his shirt. My Derby hat tilted, veil catching on his stubble.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stupid in lace.\u201d His breath scorched my ear. \u201cThat dress hides a wire?\u201d  \n\nI kneed his thigh. He grunted, trapping my leg between his. \u201cWhat\u2019s Moretti\u2019s stake in Kensington\u2019s train?\u201d  \n\nA chuckle vibrated through me. \u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire, doll.\u201d  \n\nOutside, Enzo\u2019s thugs argued over Freddie\u2019s prone form. \u201c\u2026wake him. The Eel wants names.\u201d  \n\nVito\u2019s teeth grazed my earlobe. Not gentle. \u201cStick to society pages.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll *spank* me?\u201d  \n\n\u201cTempting.\u201d He leaned back just enough for light to slit his smirk. \u201cBut first, apologize for this\u2014\u201d  \n\nFootsteps retreated. He released me like a thief dropping a hot watch. I lunged for the door.  \n\nHe blocked it. \u201cYou owe me.\u201d  \n\n\u201cTell your boss to send a bill.\u201d  \n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t deal in cash. Only favors.\u201d His finger hooked my pearls. \u201cI\u2019ll collect.\u201d  \n\nThe snap echoed like a gunshot. Pearls rained between us.  \n\n\u201cFakes.\u201d He crushed one under his wingtip. \u201cBut you knew that.\u201d  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nFreddie snored in a berg\u00e8re chair, monocle cracked. I knelt, pretending to adjust his shoe. \u201cPoor lamb,\u201d I cooed to the gawking dowagers. \u201cThe bubbles went straight to his head.\u201d  \n\nMy fingers slid into his breast pocket. Brass bit my palm: a key, teeth gleaming. *B-12*.  \n\nThe mirror showed me Lydia at the bar, waving a handkerchief in mock distress. Behind her reflection, Vito watched me through the crowd\u2014a wolf in a Tommy gun tuxedo.  \n\nHe raised his empty champagne flute. *To the game.*  \n\nI palmed the key. Somewhere, a train whistled."
