THE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS**  \n- **Entrance**: Hidden behind a false coal chute in an abandoned tenement basement (Delancey Street).  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Flickering bare bulbs on damp brick walls.

Its theft in 1926 left a scar on the museum\u2014and Vivian\u2019s family (her uncle was the disgraced night guard).  \n- **Mine-Cart Network**: A web of pre-Civil War tunnels retrofitted with electric rails.

Neon signs flicker above pawnshops; headlines scream about gangland shootings and soaring stocks.  \n- **Tension**: The humidity feels like a held breath. Every interaction carries subtext\u2014flirtation laced with danger, offers of help that could be traps.  \n- **Eroticism**: Lingering touches in crowded speakeasies, the slide of silk stockings, whispered secrets in dark corners.

I sprinted past rotting fish crates, the *Star*\u2019s extra edition crumpled in my fist\u2014*MAYOR FLEES!*\u2014the ink bleeding into a Rorschach scream. Somewhere in this labyrinth of cranes and cargo holds, Enzo Moretti waited with Rosa and a loaded Colt. Somewhere, Vito walked into a trap wearing my lipstick like a war paint. The tunnels. They\u2019d use the tunnels. I ducked into a rusted maintenance shed, kicked aside a nest of rats, and wrenched open the hatch. The coal chute swallowed me whole. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nElectric bulbs buzzed in the tunnels, their jaundiced light catching the rails\u2019 steel teeth. I followed the tracks, lungs burning, until I heard them\u2014Rosa\u2019s muffled sobs, Enzo\u2019s nasal sneer. \u201cFamily\u2019s a weakness, *fratello*.\u201d  \n\nI crouched behind a support beam. Enzo had Vito on his knees, a pistol pressed to Rosa\u2019s temple. Her wrists were bound with piano wire, blood trickling down her fingers. Vito\u2019s face was a mask of rage and ruin. \u201cLet her go,\u201d he growled. \u201cThe Throne\u2019s gone. Kensington\u2019s finished.\u201d  \n\nEnzo laughed. \u201cBut *you\u2019re* not.\u201d He gestured to a mine cart loaded with crates. \u201cStill got one shipment to catch. Say goodbye, *innamorato*.\u201d  \n\nI moved. The derringer\u2019s crack echoed through the tunnel. Enzo\u2019s shoulder exploded. He reeled, firing wild. Vito tackled Rosa to the ground as bullets sparked the rails. \u201cViv!\u201d Vito\u2019s voice raw. \u201cThe train\u2014!\u201d  \n\nI turned. Headlights speared the darkness. The art train\u2014Kensington\u2019s last desperate gamble\u2014thundered toward us, its engine belching smoke. The Golden Throne glinted through a cargo door, bathed in hellfire red. Rosa screamed. Enzo lurched for the controls. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nChaos. Vito shoved Rosa into my arms. \u201cTake her! Go!\u201d  \n\n\u201cNo\u2014\u201d  \n\nHe kissed me, hard and fleeting. \u201c*Stop that fucking train.*\u201d  \n\nEnzo\u2019s laughter chased me as I ran, Rosa\u2019s weight sagging against my side. The tracks trembled. Twenty carriages. Ten. Five. I found the lever\u2014rusted, ancient. Threw my body against it. The switch groaned. The train swayed. For a heartbeat, the Golden Throne hovered midair, suspended in a halo of embers. Then the world tore itself apart. Metal screamed. Flunes vomited fire. The throne melted into a golden scar, its rubies popping like bloodshot eyes. Enzo\u2019s final curse dissolved in the inferno. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nI found Vito in the ashes. He limped from the smoke, shirtless and bleeding, his skin painted in soot and blisters. Alive. *Alive.* Rosa collapsed into his arms, weeping. We didn\u2019t speak. Didn\u2019t need to. The three of us staggered into the downpour, the harbor swallowing Kensington\u2019s empire one ember at a time. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nMy apartment smelled of gunpowder and wet wool. Vito stood at the window, watching dawn bruise the sky. Rosa slept on my Murphy bed, bandaged fingers curled like a child\u2019s. He turned. Our eyes met. No more lies. No more ghosts. I crossed the room. He yanked me against him, his mouth hot and hungry. We fell onto the floor, a tangle of teeth and trembling flesh. His hands mapped my scars; my nails scored his back. No tenderness\u2014just a frenzied affirmation of survival. When he finally sheathed himself inside me, we both cried out, not from pleasure, but relief. *Alive. Alive. Alive.*  \n\nAfter, we lay tangled in silk sheets, the city\u2019s sirens our lullaby. He traced my silver streak. \u201cI\u2019m taking Rosa to Albany. Fresh start.\u201d  \n\nI kissed his collarbone. \u201cCome back.\u201d  \n\nHe didn\u2019t promise. But when he slipped out at dawn, he left his silver dollar on my pillow.\n\nWrite the chapter in engaging prose. End with \"THE END\".",
    "content": "# Chapter 12: City of Ghosts  \n\nThe *Star*\u2019s presses rolled all night. By dawn, newsboys hawked my uncle\u2019s vindication on every street corner. I stood at the foot of the Kensington Museum\u2019s steps, watching tourists gawk at the *Golden Throne: Stolen No More!* exhibit through sooty glass. The relic\u2019s molten remains sat twisted behind velvet ropes, a Rorschach of greed. Someone had left a bouquet of white lilies on Arthur Sinclair\u2019s reinstated plaque. The card read: *For the man who never got to see the sunrise.* I crushed it in my fist.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nFletcher found me in the morgue of dead headlines, pouring bourbon into my coffee. \u201cPulitzer\u2019s calling,\u201d he said, tossing the wire report on my desk. His ink-stained thumb left a smudge over the word *integrity*.  \n\n\u201cThey should\u2019ve given it to Arthur.\u201d  \n\nHe lit a Camel, the match flaring in his cupped palm. \u201cDead men don\u2019t cash checks, Viv. Take the win.\u201d  \n\nI took the medal anyway. Let them drape it around my neck at some gilded luncheon. Let the mayor\u2019s empty chair haunt the dais. Kensington\u2019s trial started next week, but the city had already moved on\u2014another scandal, another corpse.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nVito came to me in dreams. The taste of his skin, the salt-and-gunpowder grit of him. But when I woke, the sheets held only the musk of loneliness and a silver dollar gleaming on the pillow. He\u2019d been gone a month.  \n\nRosa\u2019s postcard arrived on a Tuesday. *Albany smells like rain and second chances,* she\u2019d written. No return address. I tacked it to the wall beside Arthur\u2019s suicide note, now framed in absolution.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nGrand Central Station swallowed me whole. Steam hissed from the 20th Century Limited, perfuming the air with coal and ambition. I spotted him leaning against Gate 17, a leather suitcase at his feet. He\u2019d shaved. It made him look younger, softer\u2014a man who could belong to sidewalks and sunlit kitchens instead of smoke-choked tunnels.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d I said.  \n\nVito smirked, rolling the silver dollar over his knuckles. \u201cHad to buy Rosa a box of chocolates. She thinks you\u2019re a bad influence.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSmart kid.\u201d  \n\nThe station announcer\u2019s voice boomed. *Final call for Chicago.* Passengers surged around us, a river of hats and hope. Vito\u2019s gaze flickered to the platform.  \n\n\u201cYou could come,\u201d he said, too casual.  \n\n\u201cAnd do what? Knit socks while you play house?\u201d  \n\nHe stepped closer. Sandalwood and sweat. \u201cYou\u2019d suck at knitting.\u201d  \n\nThe kiss was a live wire\u2014desperate and sweet and over too soon. His thumb brushed the silver streak in my hair. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he murmured against my lips.  \n\n\u201cLiar.\u201d  \n\nHe pressed the coin into my palm. \u201cHold onto this. I\u2019ll want it when I return.\u201d  \n\nI watched him board the train, his silhouette sharp against the grimy window. He didn\u2019t wave. Neither did I.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nThat night, I wrote the last line of Arthur\u2019s story. The Remington\u2019s keys clacked like a heartbeat: *Sometimes justice is a quiet thing. A cleared name. A train whistle in the dark. A city learning to forget.*  \n\nI left the Pulitzer medal on Fletcher\u2019s desk with a bottle of rye. Let the next hungry reporter carve their name into the wood.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nThe apartment held ghosts. The dent in the floor where Vito\u2019s fist had landed during an argument. The whiskey stain on the rug from the night we didn\u2019t bother with glasses. I opened the window, let the El\u2019s rattle shake the dust from my bones.  \n\nUnder my pillow, the silver dollar winked in the moonlight.  \n\n*Come back.*  \n\nSomewhere beyond the city\u2019s glow, a train whistle answered."
