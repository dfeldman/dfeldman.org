# Chapter 3: Society’s Sharp Edge  
**Date/Time**: June 5 | 7:00 PM – 11:00 PM  

Rain lashed the Sutton Place townhouse, its Art Deco chrome accents gleaming like a sarcophagus under storm-gray skies. Viv’s knuckles hovered at the lacquered black door, her reflection warped in the brass knocker—a lion’s head with emerald eyes. *Kensington’s crest.* She straightened her stolen maid’s uniform, the starch itching her throat. Somewhere inside, a gramophone crooned *Tea for Two*, the melody sharp as a scalpel.  

The door swung open. Lydia Fitzgerald stood framed in amber light, her platinum Marcel wave flawless despite the hour. A pearlsilk robe clung to her hips, the neckline dipped just enough to reveal the edge of a lacy chemise. “Miss Sinclair.” Her voice dripped mockery. “You’re tracking mud on my Egyptian cotton.”  

Viv stepped inside, rainwater pooling around her scuffed oxfords. The foyer smelled of gardenias and betrayal. “I’ll try to bleed discreetly.”  

Lydia’s laugh was a shard of crystal. She led Viv into a parlor where mirrored walls reflected a hundred half-truths. A silver tray held two champagne coupes, bubbles winking like liquid lies. “Drink?”  

Viv eyed the flute. “Poison or piety?”  

“Darling, if I wanted you dead, I’d use headlines.” Lydia sank onto a zebrawood chaise, her movements a panther’s languid prowl. “Let’s trade shadows. You have… photos?”  

Viv tossed the envelope onto the onyx coffee table. Black-and-white evidence spilled out: Lydia and Charles Beaumont tangled in a speakeasy booth, his hand up her skirt, her mouth on his neck. “Your fiancé’s brother. Tsk.”  

Lydia sipped her champagne, unfazed. “And you want?”  

“The Met Gala guest list. With annotations.”  

“Boring.” A diamond-capped nail tapped Viv’s scarred collarbone. “Why not ask about the Mayor’s *private gallery*? The one beneath the museum?”  

Viv’s pulse spiked. *The throne.* She schooled her face to stone. “I’m here for names, not fairy tales.”  

“Liar.” Lydia rose, her robe slithering open to reveal a pearl-handled derringer strapped to her thigh. She pressed the muzzle to Viv’s ribs. “You’ve got your father’s eyes—right before they shot him.”  

Viv didn’t flinch. “And you’ve got Charles’ monogram on your garter.” She nodded to the photo. “His wife collects divorce lawyers like you collect sycophants.”  

A beat. Lydia laughed, holstering the gun. “Clever girl.” She crossed to a malachite desk, scribbled a list with a gold fountain pen. “The gallery’s real. Kensington hosts… private viewings.” Her gaze flicked to Viv’s damp uniform. “Wear something that doesn’t scream *pauper*.”  

Viv pocketed the list. “Why help me?”  

Lydia lifted her champagne. “Because watching you unravel him will be *divine.*”  

The flute met her lips. Viv knocked it from her hand—glass shattered, liquid hissed against marble. A curl of acrid smoke rose. *Cyanide.*  

“Oh, Viv.” Lydia tutted. “Trust is such a *burden.*”

St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral loomed in the downpour, its spires clawing at thunderheads. Viv shoved through the oak doors, holy water stinging the cuts on her palms. The confessional booth reeked of myrrh and mildew, the screen torn like a widow’s veil.  

“Bless me, Father, for I’ve pissed off a socialite.”  

A rasp from the shadows. “Aisle three. Candelabra donations.” *Father O’Malley.*  

Viv knelt, her knees cracking. “I need a path to hell.”  

A subway token slid under the divider. “Third rail leads to salvation.”  

She squinted at the token—1921 issue, tarnished. “And Kensington’s gallery?”  

The priest coughed, a wet death rattle. “Judas built it with thirty pieces.”  

Viv stood, dizzy from incense and lies. Something glinted under the kneeler: a scrap of Bible paper. *Psalm 62:8.*  

*Trust him, Red.*  

Vito’s jagged script.  

She crumpled the note, her father’s pocket watch ticking faster.  

CONTINUE  

Rain drummed the stained glass as Viv fled the cathedral. Beneath a gaslight, she unfolded the guest list. Lydia’s annotations swirled in bloodred ink:  

*Freddie Winslow—cocaine & loose lips.*  
*Charles Beaumont—cyanide cravings.*  
*Vatican Holdings—Dock 9.*  

Across the street, a black Packard idled. The driver’s face hid under a fedora, but the scarred knuckles gripping the wheel told her enough. *Vito.*  

She stepped into the downpour, letting the rain erase her tracks.

His car matched her pace, windshield wipers slicing the night. Viv ducked into an alley, her back pressed to wet brick. Headlights blinded her.  

“Get in.” Vito leaned across the passenger seat, Luger glinting on the dashboard. “Or bleed out here.”  

Viv slid onto cold leather. “Following me or saving me?”  

“Depends on the headline.” He accelerated, tires screeching. “The gallery’s a tomb, Viv. Even your father didn’t—”  

“Don’t.” Her switchblade pricked his thigh. “Turn left.”  

He laughed, low and dangerous. The car fishtailed toward the docks, toward the throat of the storm.
