# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows  

The smell hit me first—linseed oil and cold stone, that peculiar museum stench of preservation and decay. Sunlight fractured through stained glass above the Golden Throne’s empty pedestal, painting the papier-mâché replica in sacrilegious rainbows. My press badge swung loose against my chest as I crouched, fingertips tracing the gouges in the marble base. *W.S.* William Sinclair. The *W* had a chip missing, just like the pocket watch burning a hole in my satchel.  

“Miss?” A security guard’s flashlight beam cut through the dust motes. “Gallery closes in ten.”  

I straightened too fast, knees popping. The guard’s holster creaked as he shifted—too new, the leather still stiff. His nametag read *Joe.* “Just getting angles for tomorrow’s piece,” I lied, smiling the way Tim taught me before he left. All teeth, no eyes.  

The shadows behind the Byzantine tapestries shifted.  

Joe didn’t notice. “Reporter, huh? You here about the—”  

Steel flashed.  

I threw myself left. The blade caught silk, not flesh—my stocking split from garter to knee, blood welling in a thin red line. My father’s watch chimed noon as it hit the floor, gears scattering across seventh-century mosaics.  

“Christ!” Joe fumbled for his revolver.  

The attacker melted into the tapestry’s folds. I lunged after them, thigh burning, and collided with warm wool and citrus cologne.  

“Curiosity kills, Red.”  

The voice came from behind me, low and roughened by cigars. I whirled.  

He stood in the archway, backlit by gallery lights—a silhouette in a tailored suit, fedora tilted to hide his eyes. Silver flashed in his hand.  

I raised the watch’s broken chain like a garrote. “Try it.”  

His laugh tasted of bourbon and secrets. The lighter arced through the air. I caught it on reflex, the metal still warm from his palm. Engraved cursive glinted: *Rosa.*  

“You’re bleeding,” he said, as the tapestries stilled behind him.  

Prussian blue paint pooled at my feet.  

“Miss?” The docent clutched a spilled pigment jar, fingers stained like a bad forger’s. Her gaze darted to the lighter in my hand. “Perhaps... a bandage?”  

Joe’s flashlight found us. “What in God’s name—”  

The docent stepped between us, turpentine reeking from her smock. “A clumsy accident.” She pressed a handkerchief to my leg, her whisper urgent. “Follow the blue.”  

The stranger was gone.  

---  

Fletcher burned my draft at 2:37 PM.  

“Ghost stories.” He dropped the flaming typewritten pages into his ashtray, the *Daily Sentinel*’s bullpen choking on the stench. “You’re chasing phantoms, Sinclair.”  

I watched my byline curl into ash. *Metropolitan Museum Security Lapses—*  

“Your father’s dead.” Fletcher’s cigar glowed like the tip of a bullet. “Let him rot.”  

The overhead fan churned smoke into cyclones. Across the room, Eleanor’s shadow paused by the archives cart. Her gloved hand fluttered—left, right, two fingers raised. Our old dorm code. *Meet me.*  

I waited until Fletcher’s door slammed. The train ticket slid from my Underwood’s carriage like a serpent’s tongue.  

*Midnight. Don’t be late. —V*  

Eleanor’s note followed, tucked between carbon copies.  

*Follow the blue. —Madame X*  

My stocking crackled, blood gone stiff against skin.  

---  

The Blind Owl breathed gin and betrayal. Neon bled through nailed-shut windows as I limped past Sammy the bartender. He polished a highball glass, rag circling endlessly.  

“He’s waiting.”  

Booth three reeked of iodine and bad decisions. Vito Romano didn’t look up from stitching my thigh, needle flashing. “Sit still.”  

I gripped the table edge.  

“You’re welcome,” he said.  

“For what? Nearly getting me arrested?”  

The needle paused. “Joe’s recovering. Concussion, not a coma.” His thumb brushed the inside of my knee. “Lucky shot.”  

The phonograph scratched out *Empty Bed Blues.* A drunk stumbled past, eyes on my torn hem.  

Vito’s hand tightened. “Eyes front, Angelo.”  

The man laughed, vodka breath sour. “What’s a pretty thing like—”  

The bourbon bottle exploded against his skull.  

Glass rained down as Vito rose, brass knuckles glinting. “Apologize to the lady.”  

Angelo spat blood. “Go to hell.”  

“Already there.” Vito kicked his ribs. “Twice on Sundays.”  

I found the manifest in Angelo’s breast pocket.  

*Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight.*  

Vito’s shadow stretched over me. “Trouble follows you, Red.”  

I pocketed the paper. “I’m the one chasing it.”  

He caught my wrist, thumb pressing the scarred *W* on my palm. “Ever think maybe trouble’s chasing back?”  

The door burst open. Wind howled through the alley, carrying the stench of dead fish and diesel.  

Sammy called out. “Cops!”  

Vito crushed the manifest in his fist. “Time to go.”  

He didn’t let go of my hand.  

CONTINUE
The alley air clung thick with the promise of rain as Vito pulled me behind a stack of fish crates. Police whistles shrilled two blocks east—too close. His hand stayed clamped over mine, our palms slick with Angelo’s blood and my own. 

“They’ll check the docks first,” he muttered, peering around the crate’s splintered edge. “We need to—”

“Split up.” I yanked my hand free, the *Pier 17* manifest crinkling in my fist. “You take the sewer route past Fulton. I’ll head west through the market.”

His laugh tasted like danger. “Think I’d let you bleed out in a cabbage cart?”

Lightning flickered. The scar on his jaw gleamed silver—a childhood souvenir, he’d called it when stitching me. *Bar fight. Fork.* I’d almost believed him. 

“I don’t need a nursemaid.” 

“No.” He stepped closer, rainwater trickling down his collar. “You need a partner who knows when to run.” 

The first bullet chipped brick dust into my eyes. 

Vito shoved me sideways as the second shot ricocheted off an iron lamppost. “Move!” 

We ran. 

The dockside market lay deserted, tarps flapping like ghost sails over stalls of rotting fruit. My heel caught in a trampled peach, silk tearing further. Vito’s arm hooked my waist, hauling me into the shadow of a gutted trawler. 

“Boots. Off.” 

“Are you insane?” 

He dropped to his knees, hands already on my ankle. “You sound like a herd of tap-dancing elephants.” 

The cold seeped through my stockings as he peeled them off. His thumb grazed the cut on my thigh—a slow, deliberate stroke. 

“Still bleeding.” 

“I’ll survive.” 

His gaze lifted. “Not for lack of trying.” 

Another whistle shrieked. Closer now. Vito shrugged off his suit jacket, revealing shoulder holsters and a tattooed Madonna. “Westside Tunnel’s half a mile. Can you run barefoot?” 

I snatched the .38 from his hip. “Try to keep up.” 

He grinned—the first real smile I’d seen. It transformed him from thug to wolf. “After you, Red.” 

We wove through carcasses of forgotten industry: rusted cranes, coal barges sucked dry by time. The rain began in earnest, needling my skin through the ruined dress. Vito’s shirt went sheer, clinging to the whipcord muscles of his back. I catalogued the scars between his shoulder blades—knife work, uneven. 

*Family business,* he’d said in the speakeasy. *Import/export.* 

The tunnel mouth yawned black beneath a faded *NO TRESPASSING* sign. Vito lit a match, the flame gilding the hollows of his face. “Stay close.” 

The darkness swallowed us whole. 

Dripping water echoed like a ticking bomb. My toes slipped on algae-slick rails. Somewhere ahead, rats squealed. 

Vito’s voice cut through the gloom. “Why’d you really take the story?” 

“Same reason you carry Rosa’s lighter.” 

He stopped so suddenly I collided with his back. The match hissed out. 

“Careful,” he breathed. 

Blue light bloomed ahead—Prussian blue. The same shade Celeste spilled. 

A figure moved in the glow. 

Vito’s knife whispered free. “Behind me.” 

“Like hell.” 

We crept forward, the light resolving into a smuggler’s den. Crates stamped *KENSINGTON ESTATES* lined the walls. A woman knelt by an open container, her silhouette familiar. 

“Celeste?” I stepped into the light. 

The docent whirled, brush clattering to the floor. Half-finished replicas of the Golden Throne surrounded her—dozens of them, each marked with a tiny *HK* in blue. 

Vito’s blade pressed her throat. “Talk.” 

“They forced me!” Her fingers trembled toward a crate. “My daughter—they have her at St. Mary’s. Said if I didn’t forge the throne…” 

Ice slid down my spine. “Who?” 

The shot came from nowhere. 

Celeste jerked, crimson blossoming between her breasts. Vito lunged for me as the second bullet sparked off crate metal. 

“Down!” 

We hit the floor. Footsteps echoed—polished Oxfords, not cop boots. 

“Tsk tsk, Miss Sinclair.” A silver cigarette case glinted in the gloom. “Meddling has consequences.” 

Mayor Kensington’s voice. 

Vito’s arm tightened around me. “Run on three.” 

Celeste’s hand twitched, her final breath shaping a word: *Run.* 

We ran.  

CONTINUE
The tunnel’s black throat spat us onto the East River docks. Dawn bruised the sky, painting the warehouses in sickly grays. Vito leaned against a corroded bollard, breath ragged. His ruined shirt clung to the knife scars I’d catalogued hours earlier—twenty-three, if you counted the shallow ones.  

“You’re staring, Red.”  

I tossed him his jacket. “Counting exit wounds. You’re three shy of a sieve.”  

He caught it one-handed, the motion pulling fabric taut across his shoulders. “Choirboy compared to Kensington’s men.” His thumb brushed the Madonna tattoo as he shrugged into the jacket. “Church opens at seven. Clean yourself up.”  

The Holy Name spire pierced the low clouds ahead. I pressed a hand to my vibrating ribs—adrenaline or something worse. “What’s your angle, Romano?”  

He lit a cigarette with Rosa’s lighter. The flame trembled. “Mayor’s been skimming art shipments for years. My sister…” The cherry glowed violently. “She tried blackmailing his port commissioner.”  

The river lapped at our feet. I waited.  

“They fished her out wearing concrete shoes.” He exhaled smoke through his nose. “Your turn.”  

The confession surprised me more than the cold. “My father guarded the Golden Throne.” I touched the scar on my palm. “Kensington framed him for the heist. He died in the Tombs, choking on his own blood.”  

Vito’s cigarette described an arc into the water. “So we’re both chasing ghosts.”  

“Yours have better shoes.”  

His laugh crumbled into a cough. The first ferry horn of the day drowned it out.  

---  

Fletcher’s cigar ash snowed across my desk.  

“Met gala puff piece.” He slapped down a society column draft. “Or start typing your resignation.”  

Eleanor’s cart squeaked past, the scent of lavender soap cutting through the newsroom’s perpetual haze. Her gloved finger tapped twice on my desk—*check the drawer*.  

I waited until Fletcher’s office door slammed. The secret compartment in my typewriter tray held two items:  

1. A train ticket to Poughkeepsie.  
2. Eleanor’s note, written in our old dorm cipher—*Blueprints in archives. Follow the tracks.*  

The *Daily Sentinel*’s morgue archives reeked of mildew and regret. Eleanor materialized between stacks of yellowed obituaries, her cane tapping three times—all clear.  

“Kensington’s grandfather.” She unrolled blueprints across a autopsy photo of John Doe #27. “Built the original sewer lines in 1889.”  

Prussian blue markings snaked across the map.  

“Secret tunnels.” My finger traced the path from City Hall to Pier 17. “Big enough for art shipments.”  

Eleanor’s glove creaked as she squeezed my wrist. “They killed a docent last night.”  

“Celeste.” The name tasted like gunpowder.  

Her nod sent dust motes swirling. “Her daughter’s at St. Mary’s. Comatose.”  

The train ticket burned against my thigh.  

---  

Midnight found me squinting through the *Hudson Valley Star*’s grimy window. The Poughkeepsie freight yard swam in rain and shadows. A figure coalesced under flickering gaslight—wide-brimmed hat, tailored overcoat, silver-tipped cane.  

Kensington.  

His gloved hand brushed the freight car’s padlock. Steel groaned.  

I stepped into the light.  

“Miss Sinclair.” His smile glinted like a straight razor. “Come to document civic improvements?”  

The Golden Throne gleamed inside the car, Byzantine eyes judging us both.  

My press badge caught the light. “Just getting angles, Mr. Mayor.”  

His cane’s hidden blade kissed my throat. “Such a waste. You have your father’s—”  

The gunshot cracked the night.  

Kensington staggered. Vito stepped from the shadows, smoke curling from his .45.  

“You missed,” I observed.  

“Did I?” He nodded at the mayor’s ruined hand—the one holding the blade.  

Kensington’s scream was sweeter than a byline.  

CONTINUE
Kensington's blood pattered on the freight car's steps, each drop a metronome counting down his rage. Vito kept the .45 trained on the mayor's good hand.  

"Call your dogs off," he said, too calm. "Or the next bullet takes a kneecap."  

The mayor's laugh came out a wheeze. "You think this ends with me?" He nodded at the throne. "That's just the bait."  

I climbed into the freight car, my bare feet crunching over coal dust. The throne's emerald eyes followed me—Byzantine judgment carved in gilded oak. My father's initials glinted on the base, hidden beneath fresh gilding.  

"Viv." Vito's voice tightened. "We need to—"  

The first Molotov cocktail shattered against the tracks.  

Flames roared up the freight car's sides. Heat clawed at my cheeks as I grabbed the throne. It wouldn't budge.  

"Leave it!" Vito hauled me backward as the second firebomb hit.  

Kensington's laughter chased us into the storm. "Run, little rats! The maze has only just begun!"  

We fled through a gauntlet of shadows and sirens. By the time we collapsed in the Blind Owl's back room, dawn bled through the whisky bottles.  

Sammy wordlessly handed me a gin-soaked rag. Vito paced like a caged panther, reloading his .45 with trembling hands.  

"You knew." I pressed the rag to my blistered palm. "About the throne being bait."  

He spun the silver lighter. "Kensington's been recruiting artists. Forgers. Thought it was for fakes."  

The truth settled like lead. "They're copying the throne. Creating multiples to hide the real one."  

"Twenty-seven," he said softly. "One for each borough precinct chief."  

The number punched through me. My father died guarding a decoy.  

Sammy cleared his throat. "Got a message." He slid a blue envelope across the bar.  

Eleanor's cipher unfolded into a single phrase: *St. Mary's burns at noon.*  

Vito's knuckles whitened around his glass. "Celeste's daughter."  

I stood, legs shaking. "We need—"  

"To stay alive." He caught my wrist. "Kensington's got every cop in the city hunting us."  

The scar on his thumb aligned with mine. Twin *W*s.  

"Then we hunt first." I grabbed his revolver. "Starting with the men who lit that fire."  

His smile cut through the gloom. "Always knew I'd hell with a redhead."  

We stepped into the dawn, the throne's ashes coating our tongues.  

CONTINUE
The air stung like a slapped cheek as we reached St. Mary’s—smoke pluming from third-floor windows, nurses herding patients into the rain-soaked courtyard. Vito gripped my elbow as we pushed through the crowd, his voice cutting through the chaos.  

“Pediatrics wing’s east side! Look for—”  

A nun careened into us, habit smoldering. “They’ve barred the doors!”  

I followed her trembling finger. Men in police uniforms chained the east exit, their badges gleaming too bright in the firelight. Kensington’s dogs.  

Vito pressed Rosa’s lighter into my palm. “Create a distraction.”  

The flame kissed a stack of medical charts. I watched fire climb linen curtains—a journalist’s guilt burning with the hospital sheets.  

“Fire!” The fake cop’s shout tore through the night.  

Vito’s knife found the chain’s weak link. We slipped through as the hall clock chimed twelve, its hands melting.  

Room 317 reeked of ether and betrayal. The girl lay still beneath a nameplate: *Marie Moreau. Age 9. Coma, induced.*  

“Got you.” Vito gathered her like fractured glass, IV tubes snapping.  

A framed photograph trembled on the nightstand—Celeste painting while Marie danced. I smashed the glass, pocketing the slip hidden behind.  

*Tunnels converge at Station Y-17. Bring the eye.*  

Shouts echoed downstairs. Vito nodded to the window where laundry lines crisscrossed the alley. “Time to fly, Red.”  

The first gunshot shattered the IV bag as I swung onto the ropes. Rain-slick linen burned my palms, Marie’s limp body cradled between us. We hit the dumpster as the window exploded above, fire breathing down our necks.  

Vito pressed Marie’s cold hand to my racing heart. “Keep her safe.”  

“Where are you—?”  

His kiss tasted of smoke and promises. “Finishing what we started.”  

The shadowmen poured from the burning hospital. Vito walked toward them, brass knuckles catching the hellish glow.  

I ran the opposite way, Marie’s breath shallow against my neck. The crumpled photo slip burned against my thigh—a map fragment drawn in Celeste’s Prussian blue.  

Somewhere behind me, bones cracked. Someone screamed.  

The night swallowed Vito’s war cry whole.  

CONTINUE
The tunnel’s heartbeat thrummed through the tracks beneath my feet—distant subway trains vibrating in the dark. Marie’s head lolled against my shoulder as I deciphered Celeste’s map under the flicker of a stolen match. Prussian blue arrows snaked toward Station Y-17.  

“Almost there,” I lied, tasting blood from bitten lips.  

The match died. Something scuttled in the blackness—rats or worse.  

A hand clamped over my mouth.  

“Shhh.” Vito’s voice, raw as fresh meat. His other arm hung limp, sleeve shredded. “They’re herding us.”  

I passed Marie to him, his blood warm against her cheek. “How many?”  

He pressed Rosa’s lighter into my palm. “Enough to make it fun.”  

The flame revealed his face—split brow, grin feral. Behind him, the tunnel yawned into a vaulted chamber. The Golden Throne sat enthroned on railway ties, its emerald eyes glowing in the firelight.  

“Decoy,” I muttered.  

“But convincing.” Vioto kicked the false relic. A hidden compartment sprang open—photos. My father shaking hands with Kensington. My father bleeding on museum marble.  

Footsteps echoed. Eleanor stepped into the light, revolver steady.  

“Viv.” Her glove creaked on the trigger. “The blueprints.”  

I tightened my grip on Marie. “You?”  

“St. Mary’s bills don’t pay themselves.” She gestured with the gun. “The map.”  

Vito shifted—a predator coiling. Eleanor fired at his feet.  

“I’ll wing you, Romano. Promise.”  

The throne’s armrest snapped off in my hands. I swung blind.  

Wood cracked bone. Eleanor’s scream mingled with Marie’s whimper.  

Vito pounced, disarming her in a move too smooth for a dockside thug. “You’re better than this, Brooks.”  

Eleanor spat blood. “You don’t know hungry.”  

I tore the map scrap from her clutch. “Run. Now.”  

The ceiling exploded.  

Kensington descended through rubble on a platform lift, cane gleaming. “Bravo, Miss Sinclair. You’ve found my gallery.”  

The walls shifted—false panels sliding to reveal masterpieces: Van Gogh’s *Starry Night*, the missing Amber Room panels. The Golden Throne sat central, its true form radiant.  

Vito pressed against me, brass knuckles ready. “Dance?”  

Kensington’s blade whispered free. “Let’s.”  

CONTINUE
The air thickened with the tang of oil paint and blood as Kensington’s blade slashed toward Vito’s throat. He ducked, brass knuckles glancing off the mayor’s ribs. The cane’s hidden edge carved a gash in Van Gogh’s starry swirls, releasing a curl of centuries-old varnish.  

“Careful!” I snatched a gilt frame from the wall—a Degas dancer frozen mid-pirouette. “That’s worth more than your soul.”  

Kensington laughed, parrying Vito’s jab. “Art’s value lies in ownership, my dear. A lesson your father never learned.”  

The name hit like a sucker punch. I swung the frame. Glass shattered across his shoulders. “He died protecting beauty from vultures like you!”  

Marie moaned in the corner, her small form dwarfed by Titian’s voluptuous Venus. Eleanor crouched beside her, gun trembling between surrender and defiance.  

“Viv, the throne!” Vito grunted, blocking a strike that sent his knuckles clattering across marble. “The eyes!”  

I lunged for the Golden Throne. Kensington’s blade bit into my calf. Pain exploded, but the emerald eyes stared cold—judging, waiting. My father’s initials gleamed beneath the armrest.  

*W.S. 6/3/26.*  

The day he died.  

I twisted the *S*. A compartment sprang open, disgorging photographs. Kensington shaking hands with mob bosses. Kensington aiming a revolver at my father’s back.  

“Front page material,” I spat.  

The mayor’s roar shook dust from the ceiling. “You think truth matters? I own the presses! The police! The—”  

Eleanor’s gunshot split the word.  

Kensington staggered, clutching his shoulder. Eleanor stood, tears cutting through soot. “You don’t own mothers.”  

Chaos erupted.  

Vito tackled Kensington into Monet’s water lilies. Canvas ripped. I scrambled for the fallen gun as Marie’s eyelids fluttered.  

“Stay with me, sweetheart.” I pressed Celeste’s photo into her hand. “Your mama’s waiting.”  

Across the room, Vito straddled the mayor, fists rising and falling like a blacksmith’s hammer. “For Rosalia! For William! For every soul you—”  

The tunnel shuddered. Masterpieces slid from walls as tracks rumbled overhead.  

“Subway!” I hauled Marie up. “The supports are going!”  

Vito landed one final blow. Kensington’s signet ring skittered into the shadows. “Move!”  

We fled through the disintegrating gallery, masterpieces crashing around us. Eleanor hesitated, then sprinted ahead toward a sliver of daylight.  

“The throne!” I screamed over the din.  

Vito gripped my arm, steering me forward. “Let it burn.”  

We emerged into the acidic dawn as the tunnel collapsed. The Golden Throne’s final scream of twisting metal echoed our ragged breaths.  

Marie stirred in my arms. “Mama…?”  

Eleanor sank to her knees, the gun clattering to the cobblestones. “I’ll take her. They’ll need someone to blame.”  

Vito’s hand found mine, bloodied and unsteady. “Your story’s waiting, Red.”  

Across the river, the *Daily Sentinel*’s presses roared to life.  

CONTINUE
The *Daily Sentinel*’s lobby reeked of fresh ink and fresh lies. I limped past the front desk, my bloodied stockings drawing stares from copy boys. Fletcher’s bellow rattled the frosted glass of his office.  

“Sinclair! My desk. Now.”  

Vito lingered by the elevators, rolling a toothpick across his split lip. “Need backup?”  

“I’ve handled worse than a hungover editor.”  

His smirk faded. “He sells you out, I sell his teeth.”  

The pressroom’s clatter died as I entered. Fletcher stood at his window, the skyline sprawled behind him like a jilted lover.  

“Well?” He didn’t turn. “Where’s your Pulitzer?”  

I dropped the photos on his desk—Kensington’s sneer frozen mid-bribe. “Front page. Today.”  

He thumbed the bullet hole in the Degas portrait. “You’re asking me to declare war on City Hall.”  

“Asking?” I flipped the switch on his intercom. The presses roared to life below. “They’re already running.”  

His cigar trembled. “You’ll burn this paper to ash.”  

“Funny.” I pulled Rosa’s lighter from my cleavage. “I’ve got the matches.”  

---  

The headline hit the streets at noon: *MAYOR’S GOLDEN LIES EXPOSED*. I bought three copies from a newsie with Eleanor’s eyes.  

She stood outside St. Mary’s, Marie’s hand clutched in hers. The girl’s laugh fluttered like a stolen sonnet.  

“She woke an hour ago.” Eleanor’s glove brushed my sleeve. “Asked for her mother.”  

The wind carried the salt of the Hudson, the sweetness of roasting chestnuts. “You’ll run?”  

“Far.” She pressed a ticket into my hand—California, one-way. “But first, penance.”  

We watched two beat cops drag Kensington from City Hall. His cuffs gleamed brighter than the throne ever did.  

---  

The Blind Owl’s neon buzzed like a drowsy wasp. Vito stood behind the bar, mixing a gin fizz with hands that had rearranged a mayor’s face.  

“On the house, Red.”  

I traced the bullet hole in the mahogany. “Since when do you give free drinks?”  

“Since I own the joint.” He nodded to the deed on the wall—Sammy’s scrawl beside his own.  

The gin burned clean. “What happens now?”  

His thumb smeared condensation down the glass. “Had enough of tombs and thrones.”  

The jukebox crooned *Ain’t Misbehavin’*. I thought of Marie’s laugh, Celeste’s last breath, Eleanor’s gun gleaming in the dark.  

Vito’s pinky hooked mine. “California’s got beaches. And better bourbon.”  

“Beaches breed complacency.”  

“So we’ll dig up new ghosts.” He pressed a train ticket beside Eleanor’s. “Together.”  

The door jingled. A messenger boy thrust a telegram at me.  

*THRONES MULTIPLY. TRUTH WAITS. —X*  

Vito plucked the paper from my fingers. “Trouble follows.”  

“Or we follow it.”  

His lips found the scar on my palm. The same *W* as his own.  

Outside, Manhattan held its breath. Somewhere west, another throne glittered.  

We drank to the hunt.
