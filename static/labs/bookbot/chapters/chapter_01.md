**# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows**  

The stink of linseed oil hit me like a sucker punch when I stepped into Gallery 17. June sunlight fractured through stained glass windows, painting the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne once sat in jagged shards of color. My fingers found the initials carved into the marble base—*T.S.*—and for a heartbeat, I smelled Old Spice and gun oil instead of museum dust.  

“Press badge don’t give you permission to fondle exhibits, Miss Sinclair.”  

Guard Joe’s voice snapped me back. His holster creaked as he shifted weight, nightstick tapping a Morse code of impatience against his thigh. I held up my hands in mock surrender, the chain of Dad’s pocket watch digging into my palm where I’d clenched it in my satchel.  

“Just admiring the craftsmanship,” I lied, tracing the chisel marks around the initials. “That papier-mâché replica’s almost convincing. From five feet away.”  

His laugh turned into a wet cough. “Tell that to the Met’s insurance adjusters.”  

The gallery door groaned. A docent with paint-stained fingers hurried in, her blonde chignon unraveling. Prussian blue smeared across her smock matched the shade dripping from the “Byzantine artifacts” sign she carried.  

“Terribly sorry!” Her French accent wobbled as she mopped the spill with a rag. “The restoration team—*mon dieu*, such a disaster upstairs!”  

Something glinted in the puddle. Not glass. A key.  

Cold steel kissed my thigh before I could bend.  

“Scream and I fillet that pretty neck,” a man’s voice hissed.  

The blade sliced through silk stocking, blood welling hot. I stomped backward, crunching his instep with my Oxford heel. He grunted. The knife clattered as I whipped around—  

Empty air.  

Only the Byzantine tapestries swayed, their gold threads catching light where someone had slipped behind.  

“You alright, Red?”  

The new voice rolled through me like bourbon smoke. A man leaned in the doorway, silver lighter flicking open and shut in his hand. *Click. Click. Click.* Black hair gleamed with too much pomade, his shirt sleeves rolled to reveal forearms corded with muscle and old scars.  

I pressed a hand to my bleeding leg. “Do I look alright?”  

He shrugged, all loose-limbed nonchalance. “Curiosity kills. But since you’re still breathing…” The lighter arced through the air. I caught it on reflex—engraved with a single name. *Rosa.*  

“Check your six next time.” His grin showed crooked teeth. “This museum’s got more snakes than the Bronx Zoo.”  

The docent whimpered. I turned just in time to see her “accidentally” kick the key under a display case. Prussian blue paint streaked the floor in the exact pattern of tunnel maps I’d seen in Dad’s old case files.  

Guard Joe’s radio crackled to life. “All units to Egyptian Wing—possible 10-31!”  

I limped toward the exit, blood trickling into my shoe. The stranger’s gaze burned between my shoulder blades.  

“Keep the lighter, Red,” he called. “Looks better on you anyway.”

The newsroom ceiling fans churned cigar smoke into a toxic soup. I dabbed iodine on my thigh under the desk, hissing as it seared the knife cut. My typewriter held a half-finished expose: *Mayor’s “Cleanup” Campaign Leaves Bloodstains on Fifth Avenue.*  

Fletcher’s shadow fell across the page. “Ghost chasing again, Sinclair?”  

He yanked the paper free, match flaring. My words curled black at the edges.  

“That was three days’ work!”  

“And worth less than the ash.” His jowls quivered. “No one cares about dead janitors or missing gold chairs. Give me gangland shootings. Mistress scandals. *Real* news.”  

The elevator dinged. Eleanor’s archives cart squeaked past, her lace glove brushing my shoulder. A scrap of stationery fluttered into my lap—*Follow the blue. -Madame X*  

“You’re not even printing the obits anymore,” I spat at Fletcher.  

“Obits don’t sell papers. *This* does.” He slapped down the morning edition: *FLAPPER FOUND DEAD IN HARLEM JAZZ JOINT*. Beneath the headline, my byline had been stripped.  

The clatter of keys around us died. Reporters stared like vultures scenting weakness.  

I stood too fast, my torn stocking rasping. “My father—”  

“Died a thief.” Fletcher’s smile showed nicotine-stained teeth. “Keep digging his grave deeper, Viv. You’ll hit China before you hit truth.”  

The ladies’ room mirror showed a pale stranger. Auburn hair clung damp to my neck, gray eyes fever-bright. I scrubbed blood from my hands as the stall door banged open.  

Eleanor leaned against the sink, her cane trembling. “Gallery 17’s security logs disappeared. But I found this.”  

A train ticket slid under the partition. *Grand Central → Dock 9. Midnight.*  

“Who’s Madame X?” I whispered.  

Her reflection smiled. “Someone who knows what it’s like to drown in men’s lies.”  

The door creaked. We froze as Lydia Fitzgerald swept in, emerald earrings catching the light.  

“Darling Viv!” Her perfume—Jicky by Guerlain—clogged my throat. “Heard you’re sniffing around the Met. Careful, hmm? Museums eat curious girls for breakfast.”  

She dropped a matchbook into my palm. *The Blind Owl. 45 Mulberry.*  

“Ask for Sammy. Tell him…” Her gloved finger traced my collarbone. “The canary sent you.”  

Midnight found me limping past Luigi’s Tailor Shop, the ticket burning in my purse. A neon owl’s eyes blinked red through boarded windows.  

Three knocks. A slit opened.  

“Password?”  

“The canary—”  

The door swung wide. Smoke and gin washed over me. A jazz trumpet wailed from a cracked phonograph as I pushed through the crowd.  

“Whiskey neat,” I told the bartender.  

Sammy’s gold tooth glinted. “Ain’t you Viv Sinclair? Vito said you’d come.”  

Ice clinked as he poured. “He’s patching bullet holes in back. Try not to scream—he’s shy.”  

The storeroom reeked of iodine and blood. Shirtless, Vito hunched over a cracked mirror, suturing a gash on his ribs. Muscle rippled under olive skin as he turned.  

“Jesus, Red. You bleed everywhere or just museums?”  

He pressed a flask to my lips. Cheap rye burned away my retort. His fingers—knuckles split and stained with ink—skimmed my torn stocking.  

“Got a thing for knives?”  

“Got a thing for assholes who steal lighters.” I tossed Rosa’s at his chest.  

His smile died.

His hands were steadier than mine. Vito motioned me onto a crate, the whiskey sting on my tongue doing nothing to dull the ache in my thigh. He watched my skirt’s hem ride up as he peeled the torn stocking away.  

“This needs stitches,” he said.  

“You offering?”  

The needle flashed silver. “Wouldn’t be my first time sewing up pretty things.”  

I bit my lip as thread tugged flesh. His knuckles brushed my inner thigh—once, twice. Not accidental.  

“So.” His breath warmed my knee. “Why’s a society columnist sniffing around stolen thrones?”  

“Same reason a mobster bartender carries a switchblade in his sock.”  

He grinned against my skin. The door banged open.  

“Drinks, Vito!” Sammy shouted. “And keep the redhead quiet—Burns’ boys are sniffing outside.”  

The bar’s roar swelled as we stepped out. A drunk in a pinstripe suit grabbed my waist.  

“Dance, doll?” Rotgut breath scalded my cheek.  

Vito’s bottle smashed across his skull. Glass shards glittered in bourbon puddles as the man crumpled.  

“Anyone else?” He wiped his mouth with a bloody fist.  

Silence fell. Then—  

“Harding’s dead!”  

A woman’s scream split the air. The crowd surged toward the door where a man sprawled, blood pooling under his head. Prussian blue smudged his collar—same shade as the museum key.  

Vito hauled me into the alley as sirens wailed. A train ticket fluttered from the dead man’s pocket.  

*Midnight. Pier 17. Cargo Hold 9.*  

He pressed the bloodstained paper into my hand. “Still think chasing ghosts is fun, Red?”  

The answer tasted like his kiss—whiskey, violence, and the sweet rot of lies.

The Hudson breathed diesel fumes as I limped toward Pier 17’s skeletal outline. Fog clung to rusted cranes like cobwebs on a corpse. Somewhere in the dark, waves slapped against hulls filled with secrets.  

A shadow detached from the trawler’s hull—Vito’s cigarette flaring red.  

“Took you long enough.”  

“Had to lose Burns’ tail.” I nodded at the switchblade in his hand. “Expecting company?”  

“Always.”  

We picked through crates marked MACHINERY. Inside one, Renaissance Madonnas stared blankly through straw packing. The Golden Throne wasn’t here.  

“Check the manifests.” Vito jerked his chin at the trawler’s cabin.  

A guard’s flashlight swept the deck. I ducked behind an oil drum, my pulse loud enough to drown the foghorn. The guard passed—then stiffened.  

“Press badge,” he sneered, grabbing my arm. “Kensington said you’d come.”  

His knife glinted. I kneed his groin, grabbing the pistol at his hip. The safety stuck.  

Vito’s blade found the guard’s throat. “Wrong move, *idiota*.”  

Blood pattered on my shoes. The manifest in his pocket bore Celeste’s signature—and a smudge of Prussian blue.  

“Tunnels,” I breathed. “Under City Hall. Dad’s notes—”  

A shot rang out. Wood splintered by my ear.  

“Run!” Vito shoved me toward the water.  

We leapt onto a passing barge as more gunfire chased us into the fog. His laugh was wild against my neck.

The safe house stank of mildew and betrayal. Vito lit a kerosene lamp, revealing peeling wallpaper and a mattress crawling with questions.  

“Why’d you help me?” I pressed the gun to his chest.  

He unbuttoned his shirt slowly. A bullet scar bloomed above his heart. “Recognize this?”  

My breath caught. Dad’s service revolver—missing since the heist.  

“Your old man took a bullet meant for me.” His thumb brushed my trembling lip. “Been repaying that debt ever since.”  

The mattress creaked. Outside, rain began its interrogation.

Dawn found us in the Met’s tunnels, Celeste’s key turning in a rusted lock. The Golden Throne gleamed in our lamplight—dripping with forgery.  

“Fake,” Vito hissed.  

But the real treasure lay underneath: Dad’s journal, wrapped in oilskin.  

*Kensington ordered the hit,* the last entry read. *Protect the throne—*  

A shot echoed. Vito tackled me as the journal exploded in paper shrapnel.  

“Miss me, darling?” Lydia Fitzgerald stepped from the shadows, pearl-handled derringer smoking.  

CONTINUE  
**(Current word count: 2,059)**  

----  

The carousel of lies kept spinning. Lydia’s bullet grazed my shoulder. Vito’s knife found her thigh. We escaped through steam vents, Dad’s burned words clinging to our skin.  

In the Blind Owl’s back booth, I traced the entry’s fragmentary warning: *...throne moves tonight...pier...*  

Sammy slid over a gin rickey. “Heard Kensington’s throwing a gala.”  

Vito’s hand settled on my lower back. “Feel like dancing, Red?”  

His lips tasted of vengeance and vermouth. Somewhere, a throne waited to bleed.

The Kensington estate’s ballroom shimmered with deception. I adjusted my emerald headband, forgery documents tucked into my garter.  

“Eyes left,” Vito murmured, his tuxedo smelling of gun oil and orchids.  

The Mayor waltzed past with Lydia on his arm, her limp barely noticeable. Her laugh sliced through the orchestra’s swell.  

“Darling Viv!” She air-kissed my cheeks. “Still playing Nancy Drew?”  

Vito’s hand tightened on my waist. “Still selling out your friends?”  

The music crescendoed. A waiter dropped a note into my champagne flute: *Library. Now. -X*  

Between the leather-bound lies, Eleanor waited with a blueprint.  

“Tunnels connect to the docks,” she whispered. “They’re moving it tonight.”  

Shouts erupted downstairs. Gunfire replaced violin strings.  

Vito smashed the window. “Time to go, Nancy Drew.”  

We repelled down ivy, his arms a vise around me. The throne was already screaming.

Pier 17 swallowed us whole. Moonlight razored through crane shadows as we crept toward Cargo Hold 9. The Golden Throne sat exposed under a tarp, emeralds glinting like dead men’s eyes.  

“It’s a decoy,” I realized too late.  

Celeste stepped from the darkness, scalpel glinting. “Clever girl.”  

Her blade slashed toward Vito. I fired.  

The throne toppled. Underneath—the real one, crusted with blood and secrets.  

Sirens howled. Celeste fled into the fog, her scream trailing behind.  

Vito pressed Dad’s lighter into my palm. “For luck.”  

We kissed as the world burned.

The front page screamed the next morning: *MAYOR’S SECRET ART HOARD EXPOSED!* My byline bled ink below the fold.  

Fletcher dropped a severance check on my desk. “Pack your things.”  

Eleanor’s note arrived with my coffee: *She’s at St. Mary’s. Room 214.*  

The orphanage walls echoed with lost laughter. The girl looked up from Celeste’s sketchbook, her mother’s eyes staring through me.  

“Are you the lady who killed the bad men?”  

Vito’s motorcycle roared outside. The future tasted like gasoline and stolen emeralds.

We raced the storm west. Somewhere beyond the Hudson, another throne waited in another city’s guts.  

Vito’s laugh rumbled against my spine. “Regrets, Red?”  

The wind stole my answer. Lightning forked the sky, etching our shadow—a two-headed beast hungry for truth.

The motel bedsprings sang off-key. Vito traced the scar on my thigh.  

“Still think I’m an asshole?”  

I bit his shoulder. “Worse. You’re a romantic.”  

Dawn found us mapping heist routes on skin. The throne was already rotting.

Burns found us in Tucson. His gold badge couldn’t hide the fear.  

“Kensington’s dead,” he panted. “They’re pinning it on you.”  

The gun felt heavier this time. Vito’s hand closed over mine.  

“Your move, Nancy.”  

We left Burns in the desert, his confession clutched in my fist. The throne kept laughing.

The telegram arrived in El Paso: *Need you back. -E*  

Eleanor’s codebook translated the rest: *New throne. New lies. Same snakes.*  

Vito packed the Colt. I loaded the typewriter.  

Some ghosts won’t stay buried.

The Met’s new exhibit glittered with lies. Gallery 17’s plaque mocked me: *Generously Donated by the Kensington Estate.*  

Celeste’s daughter pressed a folded crane into my hand. Inside: *He’s watching.*  

Mayor Kensington’s portrait leered from the wall. Same ice eyes. Different tie.  

Vito’s lighter flared. “Burn it?”  

The fire alarm wailed. We ran laughing into the storm.

The safe deposit box held Dad’s final secret. Photographs of Kensington shaking hands with Capone. Shipping manifests. A list of names.  

Vito whistled. “This could topple empires.”  

I fed a page to the fireplace. “Empires have better legs to stand on.”  

He caught my wrist. “What’re you doing?”  

The flames danced in his eyes. “Starting a bigger fire.”

They came at midnight. FBI suits and Italian leather. We fought dirty.  

By dawn, the Blind Owl was ash. Sammy’s derringer cooled in my hand.  

Vito bandaged my arm with his tie. “West?”  

The train whistle screamed yes.

Wyoming smelled of sage and second chances. The diner’s jukebox crooned Bessie Smith as I typed our story.  

*Once upon a heist, a reporter and a thief…*  

Vito slid into the booth, his smile dangerous. “Ready for the next chapter, Red?”  

The throne was already calling.
