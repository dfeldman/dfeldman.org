**# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows**  

The mirror in my Hell’s Kitchen walkup showed a woman forged from stubbornness and sleepless nights. I pinned the *Daily Clarion* press badge to my lapel, its brass edges dulled from three years of Fletcher’s disdain. Dad’s pocket watch slipped into my silk stocking garter—9:15 a.m. Right on schedule for the guard shift change.  

Gallery 17’s bronze doors swallowed the morning sun whole. A security guard with shoulders like a stevedore blocked my path. “Press hour ended at eight.”  

I flashed credentials still warm from the printshop. “Vivian Sinclair. Arts & Culture.” The lie tasted of ink and desperation. His eyes lingered on the hem of my skirt climbing the marble stairs—exactly as I’d planned.  

Linseed oil and marble dust filled my lungs. June heat pressed against stained glass windows, fracturing sunlight across the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne had presided over a thousand school tours. My thumbnail found the initials carved into the base—*T.S.*—still rough after twenty years. The air shifted.  

Old Spice. Gun oil.  

“Admiring your handiwork, Miss Sinclair?”  

Guard Joe materialized by a Titian forgery, nightstick tapping Morse code impatience against his thigh. His holster creaked with the particular whine of a Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless—Dad’s service weapon before the department disowned him.  

“Merely appreciating the Met’s commitment to replica artistry.” I traced chisel marks around the initials. “Though papier-mâché seems ambitious for Byzantine thrones.”  

His laugh turned phlegmy. “Tell that to the insurance sharks circling upstairs.”  

The gallery door groaned. A willowy docent stumbled in, Prussian blue paint dripping from her smock to puddle around our feet.  

“*Pardonnez-moi!*” Her French accent trembled as she blotted the spill. “The restoration team—*c’est un désastre!*”  

Something glinted in the cobalt smear. Not glass. A key.  

I bent, silk stocking tearing as cold steel kissed my thigh.  

“Scream and I’ll gift the Met a new Pollock.” The blade pressed through my skirt, drawing first blood.  

Dad’s voice echoed from academy days long buried: *Never show fear.* My Oxford heel found his instep. Bone crunched.  

The knife clattered as I spun—  

Empty air.  

Tapestries rippled where someone had vanished behind scenes. Guard Joe’s whistle shrilled through the gallery.  

“You hit, Red?”  

The voice rolled through me like bourbon over gravel. A man leaned against the doorway, silver lighter dancing through scarred fingers. *Click. Click. Click.* Black hair gleamed with enough pomade to drown a flapper, shirt sleeves rolled past forearms mapped with knife fights and poor decisions.  

I pressed a gloved hand to my leg. “Do they let vultures in before the corpse cools?”  

He shrugged, all loose joints and calculated indifference. “Curiosity killed the cat, doll. Good thing you’ve got nine lives.” The lighter arced through sunlight. I caught it cold—*Rosa* etched in looping script.  

“Check your blind spots next time.” His grin showed a chipped canine. “This museum’s got more tunnels than the IRT.”  

The docent whimpered. Her shoe “accidentally” nudged the key beneath a display case, Prussian blue streaking the floor in the exact pattern from Dad’s case files. Guard Joe’s radio barked to life: “All units to Egyptian Wing—10-31 in progress!”  

I limped toward the exit, blood seeping into my T-strap. The stranger’s gaze burned between my shoulder blades.  

“Keep the lighter, Red. Matches your eyes.”

The Sixth Avenue El rattled past the *Clarion*’s soot-stained windows. I dabbed iodine on my thigh beneath the desk, the sting barely registering over Fletcher’s cigar fumes choking the city room.  

“Ghost hunting again, Sinclair?”  

He snatched the half-typed page from my Underwood: *Mayor’s “Philanthropy” Fund Finances Mob Operations.*  

“That’s three days’ work!”  

“And worth less than the ash.” His Zippo flared. “No one gives a damn about dead janitors or missing relics. Give me gangland shootings. Divorce scandals. *News.*”  

The elevator clattered open. Eleanor’s archive cart squeaked past, her fox fur stole brushing my arm. A train ticket fluttered into my lap—*Grand Central → Dock 9. Midnight.*  

“You’re not even printing the truth anymore,” I spat.  

“Truth?” Fletcher slammed down the morning edition: *FLAPPER FOUND DEAD IN HARLEM SPEAKEASY*. My byline had been scalped. “Your old man sold lies for a living too. At least his made money.”  

Reporters paused mid-clatter. Copy boys froze with their coffee urns.  

I stood too fast, torn stocking catching on the desk drawer. “My father—”  

“Died a thief.” His jowls quivered. “Keep digging, Viv. You’ll hit China before you hit justice.”  

The lavatory mirror showed a stranger’s face—pale under rouge, gray eyes fever-bright. I scrubbed blood from under my nails as the stall door creaked.  

Eleanor leaned on her cane, arthritis twisting her fingers. “Gallery 17’s security logs vanished. But the freight elevator maintenance schedule…” She slid a blueprint under the partition.  

“Why help me?”  

Her reflection smiled. “Because unlike Fletcher, I remember when newspapers stood for something.”  

The door slammed. Lydia Fitzgerald’s Chanel No. 5 arrived first, then the woman herself—emerald earrings swinging, lips stained the color of fresh bruises.  

“Darling Viv! Heard you’re poking around Byzantine relics.” Her gloved hand lingered on my shoulder. “Careful. Museums bury their secrets deep.”  

She dropped a matchbook into my palm. *The Blind Owl. 145½ Mulberry.*  

“Ask for the canary.”

The El’s shadow swallowed Mulberry Street whole. A neon owl blinked above a boarded-up storefront, its hoot drowned by thunder rolling in from Jersey. Three quick raps.  

“Password?”  

“The canary sings at midnight.”  

Bolts clattered. The speakeasy exhaled gin and desperation, sweat-slick bodies moving to a Bessie Smith record skipping on the phonograph. Sammy leaned across the mahogany, gold tooth glinting.  

“Sinclair.” He poured rye into a chipped teacup. “Vito said you’d come crawling.”  

The storeroom door creaked. Lamplight carved the man from shadows—shirtless, suturing a knife wound with hands steady as a surgeon’s.  

“Christ, Red. You track blood like a wounded doe.”  

Vito’s thumb brushed my torn stocking. His touch sparked something older than fear, hotter than shame.  

“Still patching up fools who pick fights,” I countered, tossing Rosa’s lighter.  

The name caught him mid-stitch. For a heartbeat, grief stripped him bare—then the mask slid back.  

“Sit.” He nodded at a whisky crate. “Unless you want to faint in front of Sammy’s customers.”  

The needle bit. His knuckles grazed my inner thigh—once, twice. Not accidental.  

“Why’s a society doll playing Dick Tracy?”  

“Same reason a bootlegger reads Nietzsche.”  

His laugh vibrated through the thread’s pull. The door crashed open.  

“Harding’s dead!”  

The crowd surged toward the entrance where a man lay sprawled, Prussian blue smeared across his collar. A train ticket protruded from his breast pocket—*Midnight. Pier 17. Cargo Hold 9.*  

Vito pressed it into my palm, blood seeping through the paper. “Still think this is a game?”  

We kissed in the alley’s stench of rotting fruit and revelation, his hands fisted in my hair like a man clinging to a cliff’s edge. Somewhere beyond the docks, fog swallowed the truth whole.

The Kensington Estate’s ballroom glittered with stolen art and borrowed time. I adjusted my emerald headband, forged documents tucked against my garter.  

“Eyes left, doll.” Vito’s tuxedo smelled of gun oil and orchids.  

Mayor Kensington waltzed past with Lydia on his arm, her limp masked by layers of silk.  

“Darling Viv!” She air-kissed my cheeks. “Still chasing phantom thrones?”  

Vito’s hand tightened on my waist. “Still auctioning city secrets?”  

The orchestra crescendoed. A waiter dropped a note into my champagne flute: *Library. Now.*  

Between leather-bound lies, Eleanor waited with blueprints.  

“Tunnels connect the docks to City Hall,” she whispered.  

Shouts erupted. Gunfire replaced violins.  

Vito smashed a window with a candelabra. “Time to fly, Nancy.”  

We repelled down ivy, my dress tearing on thorns. Charles Beaumont staggered from the hedge maze, clutching his gut.  

“Kensington...throne...” Blood bubbled on his lips.  

The pocket watch in his waistcoat read 11:07. Same as Dad’s.  

Bullets chewed marble as Vito dragged me behind a fountain. His mouth found mine—desperate, bruising—before shoving me toward the kitchen.  

A cleaver embedded where my head had been. I sprinted past screaming cooks, the throne’s absence louder than gunfire.

Pier 17’s shadows swallowed us whole. The Golden Throne gleamed under a tarp, emeralds winking like dead men’s eyes.  

“Decoy,” I breathed.  

Celeste emerged from the dark, scalpel glinting. “Clever girl.”  

Her blade slashed. I fired.  

The throne toppled, revealing the real relic beneath—crusted with blood, Dad’s watch chain tangled in its jewels.  

Sirens wailed. Vito pressed his lighter into my palm.  

We kissed as the world burned, his hands in my hair, the Hudson singing our requiem.  

---

The *Clarion*’s headline screamed next morning: *MAYOR’S SECRET HOARD EXPOSED!* My byline bled beneath the fold.  

Fletcher dropped a severance check. “Get out.”  

Eleanor’s note arrived with my coffee—*St. Mary’s Orphanage. Ask for Rosa.*  

---

The girl looked up from Celeste’s sketchbook, charcoal smudging her fingers.  

“Are you the lady who kills monsters?”  

Vito’s motorcycle roared outside. The future tasted like gasoline and absolution as I knelt.  

“The monsters are gone.”  

Her paper crane unfolded in my palm: *He’s watching.*  

---

We raced the storm west, the throne’s ashes clinging to our shoes. Somewhere ahead, another city waited to bleed.
