# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows  

The Metropolitan Museum’s signature scent hit me first—linseed oil and wet stone, the musk of preservation battling entropy. Sunlight slanted through stained glass above the empty pedestal, dappling the plaque that read *Byzantine Throne, 10th Century CE (Current Location: Unknown)*. Three years since the heist. Three years since they’d hung the theft around my father’s corpse like a medal of dishonor.  

**“Last chance, Miss Sinclair.”**  

The guard’s holster creaked as he shifted. Joe—mid-fifties, coffee stain blooming on his collar—had the resigned slump of a man who’d spent decades babysitting relics and rich fools. I flashed my press badge, the chain snagging on Mom’s cameo. “Five minutes. Security upgrade piece.”  

**“Upgrades.”** He snorted, gesturing to the nearest camera. **“They replaced the lenses with kaleidoscopes last month.”**  

The lie tasted bitter as I crouched. Silk stockings tore against marble as my fingers found the scarred pedestal edge. Dad had carved his initials here during graveyard shifts—*J.S.*, jagged and defiant. I pressed my cheek to cold stone, inhaling phantom traces of Old Spice and gun oil. His ghost lingered in every chisel mark.  

The shadow moved wrong.  

Not the waltz of cloud-covered sun through stained glass. This slithered—a serpentine ripple in the Byzantine tapestry to my left.  

**“Mr. Joe?”** I stood too fast, head swimming. **“Did they repurpose this wing for—”**  

Steel flashed.  

Pain came second. First, the visceral *snick* of blade through wool skirt. Then blood, hot and insistent, painting a trail down my thigh. Drops splattered the mosaic floor, pooling between Emperor Justinian’s stone eyes.  

**“Run,”** the shadow hissed.  

My fingers closed around iron—a candelabra from the medieval arms display I’d passed earlier. I swung blind. Fabric ripped, revealing Celeste Moreau: head conservator, paint under her nails, moth-eaten docent uniform hanging loose.  

**“You framed him,”** I gasped as her knife clanged against the candelabra. **“A man who trusted you!”**  

**“Trust’s a luxury.”** She lunged again, blade singing past my ear. **“Your father learned that too late.”**  

Dad’s pocket watch tumbled from my satchel, cracking against marble. Its arrhythmic ticking filled the gallery.  

**“Curiosity kills, Red.”**  

The new voice dripped like honey laced with strychnine. A man lounged in the archway, silver lighter dancing across his knuckles. He flipped it to me—*Rosa* etched in cursive.  

**“Vito Romano.”** He nodded at Celeste. **“And you’re blocking my uncle’s cleaner from her bonus.”**  

Celeste spat at his Oxfords. **“Tell Enzo the throne rots before I hand it to that pig Kensington.”**  

The lighter burned my palm. **“You planted evidence,”** I hissed, stepping closer. **“Made the world think my father—”**  

**“She forges Picassos, sweetheart.”** Vito’s smile chilled more than the museum’s AC. **“Framing’s an art form.”**  

Celeste lunged. I swung the candelabra. Steel rang as her blade skittered across the floor. She scrambled for the service stairs, apron spilling tubes of Prussian blue—the same shade that marked coordinates in Dad’s stolen case files.  

**“You’re bleeding on a sixth-century mosaic,”** Vito observed. **“The trustees’ll add desecration to your family resume.”**  

I fisted his pinstriped lapels. **“Why the lighter? Guilt?”**  

**“Currency.”** He peeled my fingers back, calluses snagging silk. **“Run now, meet tonight, and I’ll show you who really cut Daddy’s strings.”**  

His thumb brushed my collarbone as he shoved me toward the exit. The cameo brooch bit my sternum, Mom’s stone profile judging every step.

The *Daily Sentinel* newsroom reeked of defeat. I slumped at my desk, thigh bandaged with a pilfered handkerchief, and hammered out:  

**METROPOLITAN BREACH EXPOSES SECURITY FLAWS**  

**By Vivian Sinclair**  

**Eyewitness accounts confirm—**  

Fletcher’s meaty palm crushed the carriage return. **“Obituaries are downstairs, kid.”**  

**“The throne’s still in the city.”** I slapped Celeste’s paint-stained glove on his desk. **“Prussian blue markers in the tunnels. Dad was closing in when—”**  

**“When he became the story.”** Fletcher ignited his Zippo. **“Let it die.”**  

**“It wasn’t him!”**  

The flame kissed glove leather. **“Ghost chasing’s a young woman’s game.”** He watched synthetic flowers melt. **“You’ll end up like your old man—ink on yesterday’s front page.”**  

The elevator clanged. Eleanor’s archive cart squeaked through the bullpen, dropping a slip into my wastebasket:  

*Midnight. Don’t disappoint. —V*  

Pier 17. 11:59 PM.

The Blind Owl’s haze of gin and regret clung to my skin. I nursed a fizz at the bar, torn stocking exposing sutures. Vito materialized with a medical kit, hands steady save for the pinkie finger that trembled ever so slightly.  

**“Booth three’s discreet.”**  

**“So’s a grave.”** I didn’t budge. **“Talk here.”**  

He knelt, rolling my skirt hem with clinical precision. Iodine burned. **“Why save me?”**  

**“Kensington’s your white whale.”** His breath ghosted my inner thigh as he tied gauze. **“Enzo wants him gutted. Mutual benefit.”**  

**“And Rosa?”**  

The needle hesitated. **“Sister. Collateral damage.”**  

A drunk lurched over, reeking of regret. **“How much for the ginger?”**  

Vito rose slow, a panther uncoiling. **“You’re blocking the exit.”**  

**“Exit’s that way, slick.”**  

The broken bottle flashed. Blood arced across mahogany as the drunk howled.  

**“I said,”** Vito murmured, glass teeth glinting in the man’s shoulder, **“you’re blocking the exit.”**  

Sammy dragged the man out, leaving a crumpled manifest in his wake:  

*Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight.*  

Vito’s grin cut through cigar haze. **“Still think you’re mad?”**  

The train ticket seared my ribs.

The Packard's engine growled through fog-choked streets. I clutched the manifest, its ink bleeding from Hudson River damp. Vito drove one-handed, wristwatch glinting—11:47 PM.  

**“Celeste’s message mentioned Kensington.”** I had to shout over the wind. **“How deep is he in?”**  

**“Mayor’s the puppet master.”** Vito skidded onto South Street. **“Enzo’s the knife.”**  

The docks materialized through mist—crumbling piers, trawlers coughing rust. Vito killed the lights, pointing to a listing hull. *SS Rosa* wept Prussian blue from its seams.  

**“Sentiment?”** I nodded at the peeling name.  

**“Poetry.”** He checked his revolver. **“Enzo’s got none.”**  

Two thugs emerged from the trawler, crate groaning between them. Gold leaf winked through splintered wood.  

**“Consigliere wants it polished by dawn,”** one grunted.  

**“Polished?”** His partner spat. **“It’s been sitting in the damn—”**  

Vito stepped into the open, lighter flaring. **“Evening, boys. Tell Uncle the prodigal’s home.”**  

Recognition flared. Gunfire erupted.  

**“Left flank!”** Vito tossed me his revolver. **“Make ‘em dance!”**  

I dove behind oil barrels, bullets pinging steel. The watch in my pocket thrummed—11:54. Five minutes till midnight. Five till truth.  

Celeste emerged from the hold, blade dripping river sludge. **“Persistent little bloodhound, aren’t you?”**  

**“You loved him once.”** I circled, saltwater seeping into Oxfords. **“Why bury him?”**  

**“Love’s collateral.”** Her knife caught moonlight. **“Kensington holds the mortgage.”**  

The trawler lurched. Water gushed through rotten planks.  

**“Your daughter’s tuition?”** I gambled, recalling Dad’s notes. **“He threatened her?”**  

Celeste faltered.  

I swung a rusted chain. Metal bit her wrist. The blade clattered as we crashed into crates—Renaissance gold spilling like sins at confession.  

**“He tried to protect you both!”** Her whisper carried over creaking wood. **“Left clues in his articles. But you were busy playing reporter!”**  

Dad’s watch screamed in my ears—11:59.  

**“Down!”** Vito’s roar preceded the blast.  

Fire swallowed the hold. Celeste vanished in the chaos as the *SS Rosa* fractured. Vito hauled me up the disintegrating ladder, lungs burning. We breached as the trawler capsized, frigid waves choking curses.  

Enzo waited on the pier, silhouette framed by henchmen.  

**“Family first, boy.”** The don’s grin held rot.  

Vito’s hand found mine beneath the waves. **“Swim or die, Red.”**  

We chose the current.

The Hudson spared us at Brooklyn Bridge’s rotting pilings. Vito collapsed against stone, chest heaving. Moonlight caught the scar tissue mapping his ribs—a history written in violence.  

**“Still think I’m the villain?”** He offered a cigarette.  

**“Still think I care?”** I stole his lighter.  

The flame illuminated the manifest’s survivor—a partial consignee line: *H.K. Kensington.*  

**“Gala’s in three weeks.”** Vito nodded Uptown. **“He’ll unveil his prize.”**  

I exhaled smoke, watching it coil like the lies we’d unravel. **“Then we RSVP with fireworks.”**  

He grinned, all edge and ember. **“Welcome to the war, Red.”
