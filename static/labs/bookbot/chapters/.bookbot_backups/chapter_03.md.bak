# Chapter 3: Society’s Sharp Edge  

Lydia Fitzgerald’s townhouse glowed like a poisoned jewel against the Sutton Place skyline. Viv adjusted her cloche hat, the dossier of stolen photographs slick in her gloved hand. A butler with the dead eyes of a taxidermied owl opened the door. “Miss Sinclair.” His nostrils flared at the scent of rainwater and tenement soot on her coat. “Madam is *indisposed.*”  

Viv stepped past him, heels sinking into a Deco rug worth more than her annual rent. The parlor smelled of gardenias and deceit. Lydia lounged on a zebra-striped divan, her platinum Marcel wave catching the chandelier light like a knife’s edge. “Darling.” She didn’t rise. “I’d offer champagne, but I hear you prefer—”  

“Rat poison?” Viv tossed the envelope onto the lacquered coffee table. “Let’s skip the small talk, Lyds.”  

Lydia’s pearl bracelet clinked as she lifted the first photograph—Charles Beaumont’s naked back arching over hers in a Waldorf suite, his Yale ring glinting on the nightstand. She traced the image with a manicured nail. “You’ve developed a *vulgar* hobby, Vivian.”  

“And you’ve developed a taste for engaged bankers.” Viv slipped into the armchair across from her, knees brushing the table’s sharp corners. “The *Sentinel* prints this, your fiancé inherits his daddy’s steel mills alone.”  

A derringer slid from Lydia’s sleeve, its mother-of-pearl grip pressing Viv’s ribs. “You’re in over your painted little head.”  

Viv didn’t flinch. She’d rehearsed this dance in speakeasy bathrooms and morgue corridors. “Pull the trigger, and tomorrow’s headline reads *‘Mayor’s Mistress Murders Reporter.’*” Her smile cut. “How many suitors survive that scandal?”  

The gun wavered. Lydia’s laugh sounded like breaking crystal. “What do you want?”  

“The Met Gala guest list. Every dealer, every fence, every sycophant Kensington’s schmoozed this year.”  

Lydia poured champagne from a Baccarat decanter, the liquid bubbling ominously. Viv noted the hollow charm on her bracelet—a pearl that clicked open to reveal cyanide powder when twisted. *Charles’ last drink.* “The Mayor’s… acquisitions aren’t displayed publicly.” Lydia sipped, leaving a crimson half-moon on the rim. “He keeps his *treasures* underground.”  

“Where?”  

“Beneath the Egyptian wing.” A diamond pin slid from Lydia’s hair as she leaned close. “They say the Golden Throne’s new home has better security than Fort Knox. Motion sensors. Armed guards.” Her breath smelled of almonds and lies. “You’ll die like your father.”  

Viv pocketed the guest list, its vellum edges sharp against her fingertips. “Send my regards to Charles.”  

Rain lashed the cathedral steps an hour later. Viv knelt in the confessional, the torn screen digging into her forehead. “Bless me, Father, for I’ve sinned.”  

Father O’Malley’s rasp held no mercy. “You’re here for the box, not absolution.”  

A subway token slid through the grate, green patina staining her palm. *City Hall Loop.* “Who left it?”  

“A man with eyes like last rites.” The priest’s wheeze deepened. “Said you’d need it for the library.”  

Her pulse quickened. *The Forgotten Library.* Dad’s journal mentioned it once—*“532 Fifth Avenue, where art goes to die.”* She reached under the kneeler, finding a folded Psalm: *“Trust in him at all times, you people.”* Vito’s scrawl bled through the paper:  

***Meet me where the tracks hum. Midnight.***  

The confession curtain ripped open. Viv spun, switchblade drawn.  

Empty pews gaped like a ribcage. A single rose lay on the altar, its stem wrapped in shipping manifest tissue. She pressed it to her nose—bay rum and danger.  

Somewhere in the storm, a train whistle screamed.  

CONTINUE
The forgotten subway platform reeked of wet coal and desperation. Viv’s flashlight beam trembled across moss-caked tiles as a rat skittered over tracks humming with approaching danger. She gripped Vito’s psalm note, the paper damp with tunnel sweat. *Midnight.*  

Footsteps echoed.  

“You’re early,” Vito materialized from shadow, his collar turned up against the chill. A fresh cut split his eyebrow—Paulie’s handiwork.  

“And you’re predictable.” Viv aimed her light at his chest. “Since when do mob rats quote scripture?”  

He stepped closer, the Luger at his hip catching the glow of bioluminescent fungus. “Since the Mayor started moving relics through my grandmother’s church.” His thumb brushed the rosary in her pocket—Eddie’s rosary. “You’re digging a grave, Red.”  

“Yours or mine?”  

The tracks vibrated. Vito yanked her against the wall as a maintenance cart roared past, its cargo tarp flapping to reveal crates stamped *Vatican Holdings.* Viv’s pulse thrummed against his forearm. “The throne’s eyes,” she breathed. “They’re here.”  

He released her like she’d scalded him. “Forget the eyes. Kensington’s got a new play—shipments heading east disguised as charity donations.”  

“To where? Palermo?”  

His jaw tightened. *Rosa.*  

A clang echoed down the tunnel. Vito spun, shielding her with his body as a flashlight beam sliced the dark. “Find the bitch!” Paulie’s voice bounced off moldering bricks. “Boss wants her tongue in a jar!”  

Viv’s switchblade clicked open. “Trouble follows you like a bad cologne.”  

“You’re the common denominator.” Vito pressed a rusted key into her palm—Lyric Theatre insignia worn smooth. “Basement storage. Comb through the props.”  

She laughed, bitter. “Let me guess—another wild goose chase?”  

“Wild geese peck out eyes.” He shoved her toward an alcove. “Go!”  

She ran, the key biting her flesh. Behind her, gunfire erupted—Vito’s Luger versus Paulie’s curses. The tunnels wept green light as she stumbled into a chamber stacked with moth-eaten theater curtains. A prop trunk gaped open, its innards spilling shredded velvet and a single emerald cufflink.  

Kensington’s crest glinted in the fungal glow.  

Footsteps approached. Viv crouched, blade raised.  

“Sinclair.” Inspector Burns blocked the exit, his badge dangling from nicotine-stained fingers. “Should’ve stayed in your typewriter cage.”  

She palmed the subway token. “City Hall Loop have nice acoustics for bribes, Bobbie?”  

His smile died as she hurled the token at his temple and bolted. Dawn found her on the Sentinel’s rooftop, the guest list spread at her feet. Lydia’s looping script labeled one name with a dagger-drawn heart:  

***Charles Beaumont - Broker of Beautiful Liars.***  

Viv lit a Chesterfield with trembling hands. Somewhere below, presses roared to life with Fletcher’s exposé on dockyard arson. The emerald cufflink burned in her pocket—a twin to the one buried with her father.  

The throne’s curse whispered through the ink-stained wind: *You’re next.*
