# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows  

I arrived at the Metropolitan Museum on the morning of June 3, 1929, at exactly 10:00 AM. Gallery 17 greeted me with fractured sunlight bleeding through stained glass, dappling the floor in emerald and crimson. The air hung thick with linseed oil and the damp musk of stone—a scent that clung to my throat. At the center of the room, the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne once stood gaped like a missing tooth, its papier‑mâché replacement crude and mocking.  

My press badge swung against my chest as I approached. I traced the pedestal’s carved base, my finger catching on familiar grooves: my father’s initials. A faint aroma lingered—bay rum, sandalwood, gun oil—the ghost of him. My satchel brushed my hip, heavy with his pocket watch. The theft wasn’t just a story; it was a key.  

Guard Joe loomed nearby, hand resting on his holster. Celeste, the docent, adjusted a nearby placard, her smock streaked with vermilion and umber. She moved like a woman accustomed to blending into walls, her presence as forgettable as the exhibit labels she dusted.  

Then I saw it: a shadow shifting behind the Byzantine tapestries. Steel flashed.
I stumbled back as the blade sliced through silk and skin. Blood dripped onto the mosaics, each drop a scarlet punctuation mark.  

“Curiosity kills, Red.”  

The voice came from the doorway. Vito stood silhouetted against the light, a silver lighter flicking open in his palm. His eyes locked on mine as the lighter fell. I caught it midair. *Rosa* danced across its surface in cursive. My mother’s name etched into cold metal—a taunt or a plea? Seventeen years since her coffin lowered into Queens soil, but the wound still breathed.  

Before I could speak, Celeste knocked over a paint can—Prussian blue flooding the floor. The same shade as the tunnel maps in my notes. Not an accident. A breadcrumb. *Follow the blue,* I thought, the phrase thrumming like a second heartbeat.  

———  

The walk to the *Daily Sentinel* was a blur of grit and adrenaline. My thighs burned—half from the cut, half from the weight of that goddamned name. By 2:30 PM, I slumped at my desk, the newsroom’s cigar haze sticking to my skin like cheap perfume. My stocking clung to the half-dried wound, fabric grafting to flesh. I fed paper into the typewriter, keys clattering: *Initials. Blood. Lighter. Blue.*  

Fletcher materialized like a storm cloud. He snatched the draft, struck a match, and let flame devour the words. “Chase ghosts, you’ll join them.” Ash floated in the sink, dissolving into gray silt.  

I restarted, wrists rigid. The pain in my leg throbbed in time with the overhead fans. Eleanor’s cart creaked past. Her fingers brushed mine—*Follow the blue. —Madame X*—before she melted into the labyrinth of filing cabinets.  

The train ticket appeared next, slipped between carbon copies. *Midnight. Don’t be late. —V.* The *V* coiled in my gut. I palmed it, the paper warm from the pressroom’s fever.  

———  

The Blind Owl speakeasy stank of gin and regret. Vito found me at a corner table, his hands steady as he cleaned the cut. I kept my gaze on the broken phonograph wailing Bessie Smith. His knuckles grazed my inner thigh when the needle skipped.  

“Why Rosa?” I asked, flipping the lighter between us.  

He daubed iodine, eyes never leaving the wound. “Not my engraving.”  

A drunk lurched into us, fingers groping my collarbone. I shoved him hard, but he grabbed my wrist. Vito’s bottle met his temple. The crunch of bone. The man crumpled, leaving a crumpled manifest in his wake: *Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight.*  

“Why Pier 17?” I asked later, watching Vito wipe bourbon from his sleeves.  

He lit a cigarette. The ember flared. “That throne’s a skeleton key. Opens doors even your daddy couldn’t.”

The pier loomed at midnight, its planks groaning under my heels. Salt and diesel choked the air. Two men murmured by the cargo crates—*shipment delayed*—*boss wants it buried*. I crouched behind a coil of rope, manifest crumpled in my fist. The throne wasn’t here. Another dead end wrapped in brine.  

Back in my Thompson Street apartment, I spread the clues like tarot cards: lighter, ticket, note, bloodstained stocking. The pocket watch ticked. *Rosa.* Mother’s suicide when I was six. Father’s “accident” last spring. Coincidences were for fools.  

Sleep didn’t come.  

———  

Dawn crept through cracked blinds as I rewrote the night’s events. Every detail mattered: the bay rum, the lighter’s engraving, the way Vito’s jaw tightened when I prodded about Pier 17. I tucked the notes into a hollowed-out copy of *The Great Gatsby*—Fitzgerald’s prose hiding my own.  

At the Sentinel, Fletcher ignored me. Eleanor left a fresh pot of ink on my desk. The phone rang twice—dead air both times.  

By noon, I stood outside the tailor shop hiding the Blind Owl’s entrance. Celeste emerged, her docent uniform replaced by a cloche hat and moth-eaten coat. She froze when she saw me.  

“The blue paint,” I said, stepping into her path. “You wanted me to follow it.”  

Her laugh was a dry rasp. “Honey, I just spill things. Ask your bartender.”  

She vanished into the crowd, but not before I caught the tremor in her hands—the same tremor Father had when lying.  

———  

That night, I returned to Pier 17. The crates were gone. Only a tide-smoothed scrap of paper remained: *R.I.P. ROSA* in smudged charcoal.  

The pocket watch weighed my satchel down as I walked home. Three blocks from my apartment, a black Packard rolled alongside me. The window slid down.  

“Keep digging, and you’ll bury yourself,” a man’s voice said.  

Tires screeched. Gravel stung my cheeks.

In my bathroom, I peeled the bandage off. The stitches held. *Rosa.* The name echoed through the years. Mother’s suicide when I was six—a “tragic fall” from their bedroom window. Father’s “accident” last spring, skull cracked open on museum steps. Coincidences were for fools, and I’d stopped being one the day I found his bloody notebook hidden in the icebox.  

I poured bourbon, lit a cigarette, and stared at the manifest. Midnight had passed. The throne was still missing. But the trail wasn’t cold—it was burning.  

———  

The museum’s night guard let me in after hours. Joe’s keys jangled as we slipped into Gallery 17, his loyalty bought with a bottle of Canadian whiskey and the promise I’d never mention his brother’s arrest last fall. I knelt by the pedestal, flashlight beam catching a glint in the mortar—a shard of lapis lazuli. Prussian blue.  

Joe whistled. “Tunnels under the museum. Rumor is they connect to the docks.”  

*Follow the blue.* The phrase pulsed, insistent. I palmed the stone. “Show me.”  

He hesitated, sweat beading under his cap. “Your old man asked the same thing. Week before he died.”  

The air thickened. “And?”  

“Told him the same as I’ll tell you.” He turned toward the service elevator. “Watch your step.”  

———  

The tunnels smelled of wet earth and iron. Joe’s flashlight carved shaky circles ahead. Graffiti marked the walls—crude arrows, cryptic symbols, a faded *R* inside a circle. My thumb traced the lighter in my pocket. *Rosa. Rosalind. Red.*  

We emerged near the docks, moonlight staining the Hudson silver. Joe gripped my arm. “This is where I clock out.”  

Alone, I followed the *R*s chalked on crates until I reached a warehouse door ajar. Inside, dust motes swam in shafts of light. A single crate sat center floor.  

No throne. Just a faded playbill: *ROSALIND’S FOLLY, 1912.* Mother’s stage name glared up at me, her face blurred under decades of grime.  

———  

Vito found me at the Blind Owl’s bar. “Pier 17 was a decoy,” I said, sliding the playbill toward him.  

He studied it, thumb brushing the date. “Rosa’s been dead years. Why dredge her up now?”  

“Same reason they’re using my father’s initials. This isn’t about art.”  

He ordered two whiskeys. “It’s about blood.”  

We drank in silence, shoulders almost touching. The phonograph crooned *Nobody knows you when you’re down and out.*  

“The tunnels connect to the museum,” I said. “Someone’s using them. Moving more than thrones.”  

Vito’s smile cut sharp. “Careful, Red. Ghosts bite.”  

I slid off the stool. “So do I.”

The next morning, Fletcher cornered me at the water cooler. “Drop the art heist. City desk needs obits.”  

“I’m close.”  

He snorted. “You’re a columnist, not Dick Tracy.”  

The train ticket crinkled in my pocket. That afternoon, I boarded the 4:15 to Yonkers. The manifest’s address led to a boarded-up textile mill. Rusted chains hung from the ceiling like forgotten gallows.  

In the office, I found stacks of playbills—*ROSALIND’S FOLLY* repeated like a chant. A ledger listed payments to “X.” Madame X? Eleanor’s warning hummed in my ears.  

———  

Back at the Sentinel, I typed until my fingers cramped. Fletcher burned three drafts. Eleanor left a new code in my inkwell: *X marks the vault.*  

At midnight, I stood outside the Federal Reserve’s shadow. A figure melted from the alley—Vito, tossing me a crowbar.  

“You sure?” he asked.  

The lighter flared in my hand. *Rosa* glowed like a beacon.  

“They shouldn’t have used her name.”

———  

The vault door groaned open, revealing stacks of gold bars and document boxes. Dust swirled in our flashlight beams. Vito pried open a crate—no throne, just files stamped *CLASSIFIED*.  

My glove snagged on a folio labeled *1912*. Inside: photographs of Mother backstage at Rosalind’s Folly, laughing with men in pinstripes. One face repeated—a banker turned senator. Father’s notes scribbled in the margins: *Debts. Extortion. X marks the vault.*  

“Blackmail,” Vito muttered. “Your momma was the courier.”  

Footsteps echoed above. We froze. A voice slithered through the vents: “Should’ve let sleeping dogs lie, Red.”  

Fletcher descended the stairs, revolver glinting. Behind him, Celeste clutched a ledger—the same blue ink as her paint spill.  

“You missed the real story,” I said, gripping the folio. “Again.”  

He cocked the hammer. “Obits it is.”  

Vito moved first.  

CONTINUE  

**[Word count so far: 1,710]**  

———  

The gunshot cracked like broken glass. Vito shoved me behind a pillar, returning fire. Celeste screamed as a bullet caught her shoulder. The ledger skidded across the floor, pages splaying open—*Rosa’s* name on every line.  

Fletcher lunged for it. I tackled him, our struggle knocking over a lantern. Flames kissed the folio, devouring Mother’s face.  

“No!” Fletcher roared, batting at the fire.  

Vito yanked me up. “Time to go!”  

We fled through a coal chute, emerging in an alley reeking of fish guts. Sirens wailed in the distance.  

“The throne?” I gasped.  

“Decoy.” Vito pressed a key into my palm—an ornate thing stamped with a lapis lazuli *R*. “Real one’s buried with her.”  

The cemetery gates loomed ahead.  

CONTINUE

Dawn etched the headstones in pale gold. Rosa Alcott’s grave bore fresh dirt. We dug until the shovel struck wood.  

Inside the coffin lay the Golden Throne, its jewels glowing like captive stars. Beneath it: a letter.  

*Dearest Vivian,  
If you’re reading this, I failed. Forgive me. The throne is both map and weapon. Burn it. —Dad*  

Vito struck a match. I hesitated, tracing the engraved serpents. “What if it’s the only proof left?”  

He cupped my chin, thumb brushing ash from my cheek. “You’re proof enough.”  

The flames took hours to die.  

———  

At the Sentinel, I typed the truth. Fletcher’s desk sat empty. Eleanor left a final note: *Madame X exits stage left.*  

The lighter stayed in my pocket, *Rosa* warming to my touch. That night, Vito found me on the fire escape.  

“What now?” he asked.  

I lit a cigarette with Mother’s name. “We follow the blue.”
