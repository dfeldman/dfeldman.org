**# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows**  

The stink of linseed oil hit me like a sucker punch when I stepped into Gallery 17. June sunlight fractured through stained glass windows, painting the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne once sat in jagged shards of color. My fingers found the initials carved into the marble base—*T.S.*—and for a heartbeat, I smelled Old Spice and gun oil instead of museum dust.  

“Press badge don’t give you permission to fondle exhibits, Miss Sinclair.”  

Guard Joe’s voice snapped me back. His holster creaked as he shifted weight, nightstick tapping a Morse code of impatience against his thigh. I held up my hands in mock surrender, the chain of Dad’s pocket watch digging into my palm where I’d clenched it in my satchel.  

“Just admiring the craftsmanship,” I lied, tracing the chisel marks around the initials. “That papier-mâché replica’s almost convincing. From five feet away.”  

His laugh turned into a wet cough. “Tell that to the Met’s insurance adjusters.”  

The gallery door groaned. A docent with paint-stained fingers hurried in, her blonde chignon unraveling. Prussian blue smeared across her smock matched the shade dripping from the “Byzantine artifacts” sign she carried.  

“Terribly sorry!” Her French accent wobbled as she mopped the spill with a rag. “The restoration team—*mon dieu*, such a disaster upstairs!”  

Something glinted in the puddle. Not glass. A key.  

Cold steel kissed my thigh before I could bend.  

“Scream and I fillet that pretty neck,” a man’s voice hissed.  

The blade sliced through silk stocking, blood welling hot. I stomped backward, crunching his instep with my Oxford heel. He grunted. The knife clattered as I whipped around—  

Empty air.  

Only the Byzantine tapestries swayed, their gold threads catching light where someone had slipped behind.  

“You alright, Red?”  

The new voice rolled through me like bourbon smoke. A man leaned in the doorway, silver lighter flicking open and shut in his hand. *Click. Click. Click.* Black hair gleamed with too much pomade, his shirt sleeves rolled to reveal forearms corded with muscle and old scars.  

I pressed a hand to my bleeding leg. “Do I look alright?”  

He shrugged, all loose-limbed nonchalance. “Curiosity kills. But since you’re still breathing…” The lighter arced through the air. I caught it on reflex—engraved with a single name. *Rosa.*  

“Check your six next time.” His grin showed crooked teeth. “This museum’s got more snakes than the Bronx Zoo.”  

The docent whimpered. I turned just in time to see her “accidentally” kick the key under a display case. Prussian blue paint streaked the floor in the exact pattern of tunnel maps I’d seen in Dad’s old case files.  

Guard Joe’s radio crackled to life. “All units to Egyptian Wing—possible 10-31!”  

I limped toward the exit, blood trickling into my shoe. The stranger’s gaze burned between my shoulder blades.  

“Keep the lighter, Red,” he called. “Looks better on you anyway.”  

---

The newsroom ceiling fans churned cigar smoke into a toxic soup. I dabbed iodine on my thigh under the desk, hissing as it seared the knife cut. My typewriter held a half-finished expose: *Mayor’s “Cleanup” Campaign Leaves Bloodstains on Fifth Avenue.*  

Fletcher’s shadow fell across the page. “Ghost chasing again, Sinclair?”  

He yanked the paper free, match flaring. My words curled black at the edges.  

“That was three days’ work!”  

“And worth less than the ash.” His jowls quivered. “No one cares about dead janitors or missing gold chairs. Give me gangland shootings. Mistress scandals. *Real* news.”  

The elevator dinged. Eleanor’s archives cart squeaked past, her lace glove brushing my shoulder. A scrap of stationery fluttered into my lap—*Follow the blue. -Madame X*  

“You’re not even printing the obits anymore,” I spat at Fletcher.  

“Obits don’t sell papers. *This* does.” He slapped down the morning edition: *FLAPPER FOUND DEAD IN HARLEM JAZZ JOINT*. Beneath the headline, my byline had been stripped.  

The clatter of keys around us died. Reporters stared like vultures scenting weakness.  

I stood too fast, my torn stocking rasping. “My father—”  

“Died a thief.” Fletcher’s smile showed nicotine-stained teeth. “Keep digging his grave deeper, Viv. You’ll hit China before you hit truth.”  

The ladies’ room mirror showed a pale stranger. Auburn hair clung damp to my neck, gray eyes fever-bright. I scrubbed blood from my hands as the stall door banged open.  

Eleanor leaned against the sink, her cane trembling. “Gallery 17’s security logs disappeared. But I found this.”  

A train ticket slid under the partition. *Grand Central → Dock 9. Midnight.*  

“Who’s Madame X?” I whispered.  

Her reflection smiled. “Someone who knows what it’s like to drown in men’s lies.”  

The door creaked. We froze as Lydia Fitzgerald swept in, emerald earrings catching the light.  

“Darling Viv!” Her perfume—Jicky by Guerlain—clogged my throat. “Heard you’re sniffing around the Met. Careful, hmm? Museums eat curious girls for breakfast.”  

She dropped a matchbook into my palm. *The Blind Owl. 45 Mulberry.*  

“Ask for Sammy. Tell him…” Her gloved finger traced my collarbone. “The canary sent you.”

Midnight found me limping past Luigi’s Tailor Shop, the ticket burning in my purse like a guilty secret. A neon owl’s eyes blinked red through boarded-up windows, their glow staining puddles of gutter water the color of diluted blood. Three knocks. A slit opened, revealing a pupil swimming in gin-blurred suspicion.  

“Password?”  

“The canary—”  

The door swung wide on oiled hinges. Smoke and cheap perfume washed over me, the Blind Owl’s air thick with the musk of hidden agendas. A jazz trumpet wailed from a cracked phonograph horn, the melody warping as I pushed through constellations of silk dresses and newsboy caps. The bartender’s gold tooth caught the light when he grinned, polishing a highball glass with a rag darker than my prospects.  

“Whiskey neat,” I told him, sliding onto a stool sticky with last night’s bad decisions.  

“Ain’t you Viv Sinclair?” Sammy’s voice rasped like sandpaper on a fresh wound. He poured rye into a tumbler, ice clinking like loose teeth in a tin cup. “Vito said you’d come sniffling ’round.”  

The storeroom door creaked open, spilling lamplight across floorboards stained with things better left unnamed. I followed the scent of iodine and iron.  

Vito hunched shirtless over a cracked mirror, suturing a gash across his ribs. Moonlight through a high window painted his muscles in mercury—a topography of scars and survival. The needle flashed as he turned, shadows pooling in the hollow of his throat.  

“Christ, Red. You bleed everywhere or just museums?”  

He pressed a flask to my lips. Cheap rye burned through the last of my composure. His fingers—knuckles split and stained with printer’s ink—skimmed the tear in my stocking.  

“Got a death wish or just shit taste in men?”  

“Got a lighter thief who talks too much.” I tossed Rosa’s silver at his chest.  

His smile died mid-taunt. For a heartbeat, the mask slipped—I saw the boy who’d carried his sister’s name etched in metal long after the grave claimed her. Then he jerked his chin toward a crate, thread glinting between scarred fingers.  

“Sit. Before you ruin every rug in Manhattan.”  

The needle bit flesh. His knuckles brushed my inner thigh—once, twice. Not accidental. Pain and something hotter coiled low in my gut.  

“So.” His breath warmed my knee as he pulled the stitch tight. “Why’s a society columnist playing Nancy Drew with mobsters?”  

“Same reason a bootlegger’s got Tolstoy on his nightstand.”  

His laugh vibrated through the needle’s tug. The door burst open.  

“Drinks, Red’s done playing nurse!” Sammy shouted over the rising din.  

The bar’s roar swallowed us whole. A drunk in a pinstripe suit reeking of bathtub gin grabbed my waist, his fingers digging into fresh stitches. “Dance, doll?”  

Vito’s bottle shattered across his skull. Glass teeth glittered in bourbon puddles as the man crumpled.  

“Anyone else?” He wiped his mouth with a bloodied fist, shirt clinging to the sweat-slick planes of his chest.  

Silence fell. Then—  

“Harding’s dead!”  

A woman’s scream split the air. The crowd surged toward the entrance where a man sprawled like a broken marionette, blood pooling beneath his head in a viscous halo. Prussian blue smudged his collar—the exact shade of paint from the museum key.  

Vito hauled me into the alley, his palm searing my lower back through torn silk. A train ticket fluttered from the dead man’s pocket, blood blooming across the words *Midnight. Pier 17. Cargo Hold 9.*  

He pressed the damp paper into my hand. “Still think chasing ghosts is a lark, Red?”  

The answer tasted like his kiss—rye and ruin and the sweet rot of lies we’d both swallow whole.

The Hudson breathed diesel fumes as we limped toward Pier 17’s skeletal outline. Fog clung to rusted cranes like cobwebs on a corpse, the river’s black tongue licking at rotten pilings. Somewhere in the dark, waves slapped against hulls filled with secrets better left drowned.  

A shadow detached from a trawler’s hull—Vito’s cigarette flaring red.  

“Took you long enough.”  

“Had to lose Burns’ tail.” I nodded at the switchblade in his hand, moonlight running its edge like a lover’s finger. “Expecting company?”  

“Always.”  

We picked through crates marked MACHINERY. Inside one, Renaissance Madonnas stared blank through straw packing, their gilt frames tarnished by salt air. The Golden Throne wasn’t here.  

“Check the manifests.” Vito jerked his chin at the trawler’s cabin, breath frosting in the unnatural June chill.  

A guard’s flashlight swept the deck. I ducked behind an oil drum, chain of Dad’s watch biting into my clenched fist. The beam passed—then snapped back.  

“Press badge,” the guard sneered, yanking my arm. Steel gleamed at his hip. “Kensington said you’d come sniffing.”  

His knife glinted. I kneed his groin, fumbling for the pistol. The safety stuck.  

Vito’s blade found the guard’s throat. “Wrong move, *idiota*.”  

Blood pattered on my Oxfords like warm rain. The manifest in his pocket bore Celeste’s looping signature—and a smudge of Prussian blue.  

“Tunnels,” I breathed. “Under City Hall. Dad’s notes mentioned—”  

A shot rang out. Wood splintered by my ear.  

“*Move!*” Vito shoved me toward the water.  

We leapt onto a passing coal barge as bullets chased us into the fog. His laugh vibrated against my neck, the Hudson’s current humming a funeral dirge.  

---  

The safe house stank of mildew and mothballed regrets. Vito kicked the door shut, his arm sliding from my waist as he lit a kerosene lamp. The flame guttered, revealing peeling cabbage-rose wallpaper and a mattress stained with more stories than I wanted to know.  

"Home sweet hell," he muttered, shrugging out of his bloodied shirt. Muscle flexed beneath sweat-sheened skin, the scar above his heart pulsing like a second mouth.  

I pressed the stolen gun to his chest. "Why help me?"  

His fingers closed over the barrel, warm and unflinching. "Recognize this?" He guided my hand left, where old scar tissue formed a star-shaped crater. "Your old man took a bullet meant for me."  

The mattress springs screamed as I stumbled back. Dad’s service revolver—missing since the heist—weighed sudden and terrible in my memory.  

Vito peeled the bandage from my thigh. "Been repaying that debt ever since."  

The needle bit flesh. Outside, rain began its interrogation on the tin roof. His thumb brushed my trembling lip when I gasped.  

"Stay still, Red. Unless you want this jagged."  

We didn’t speak of the way his hands lingered, or how the storm drowned our breathing when the lamp died.

Dawn slithered through the Met’s service entrance as Celeste’s key turned in a rusted lock. Dank air clung to our clothes like a jealous lover, the tunnel’s throat swallowing our lamplight whole. The Golden Throne loomed ahead, emeralds glinting like a drunkard’s false promises.  

“Fake,” Vito spat, prying a gem loose. It rolled into shadows, revealing corroded tin beneath gilding.  

Beneath the throne lay Dad’s journal, wrapped in oilskin and decades of lies. His final entry screamed from the page: *Kensington ordered the hit. Protect the throne at all—*  

A gunshot echoed. Vito tackled me as the journal exploded in paper shrapnel.  

“Miss me, darling?” Lydia Fitzgerald stepped from the shadows, pearl-handled derringer smoking. Her emerald dress matched the throne’s false jewels. “Really, Viv—snooping in subbasements? You’ll ruin your stockings.”  

Vito’s knife found her thigh before she could fire again. Her scream brought down centuries of dust as we fled through steam vents, Dad’s burned words clinging to our skin like funeral ash.  

---  

The Blind Owl’s back booth reeked of yesterday’s gin and tomorrow’s regrets. I pieced together the journal’s fragments: *...throne moves tonight...pier...*  

Sammy slid a rickey across the table, lime bleeding into cheap gin. “Heard Kensington’s throwing a gala. All society swells and stolen art.”  

Vito’s hand settled on my lower back, thumb brushing bare skin where my dress had torn. “Feel like dancing, Red?”  

His lips tasted of vengeance and vermouth. Somewhere beyond the boarded windows, a throne waited to bleed.  

---  

The Kensington estate’s ballroom shimmered with poisoned champagne and lies. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto flappers doing the Charleston, their laughter sharp as broken stemware. I adjusted my emerald headband, forged documents tucked into my garter.  

“Eyes left,” Vito murmured, his tuxedo smelling of gun oil and orchids.  

Mayor Kensington waltzed past with Lydia on his arm, her limp masked by layers of silk. Her laugh cut through the orchestra’s swell.  

“Darling Viv!” She air-kissed my cheeks, gardenia perfume cloying. “Still playing detective?”  

Vito’s hand tightened on my waist. “Still selling out your friends?”  

The music crescendoed. A waiter with a too-polished smile dropped a note into my champagne flute: *Library. Now. -X*  

---  

Between leather-bound lies, Eleanor waited with a blueprint. Her gloves trembled as she unrolled vellum.  

“Tunnels connect to the docks,” she whispered. “They’re moving it tonight.”  

Shouts erupted below. Gunfire replaced violin strings.  

Vito smashed the window with a candelabra. “Time to go, Nancy.”  

We repelled down ivy, his arms a vise around me. My dress ripped on thorns, blood blooming like poppies on silk. Across the lawn, Charles Beaumont staggered from the hedge maze, clutching his gut.  

“Kensington wants—” His words drowned in a gurgle as another shot cracked.  

I lunged for his collapsing body. The pocket watch slipped from his waistcoat—engraved *H.K.*, hands frozen at 11:07.  

“Viv!”  

Vito yanked me behind a marble fountain as bullets chewed stone. His mouth found mine—desperate, bruising—before shoving me toward the kitchen.  

A cleaver embedded in the wall where my head had been. I kicked off heels, sprinting past screaming cooks. The throne’s absence screamed louder.

Pier 17 swallowed us whole. Moonlight razored through crane shadows as we crept toward Cargo Hold 9. The Golden Throne sat exposed under a tarp, emeralds glinting like dead men’s eyes in the gloom.  

“It’s a decoy,” I whispered, fingers brushing the too-perfect gilding.  

Celeste stepped from the darkness, scalpel glinting. Moonlight caught the arsenic green of her smock—the same shade that had dripped from her museum sign. “Clever girl.”  

Her blade slashed toward Vito’s throat. I fired.  

The crack echoed off rusted shipping containers. Celeste staggered back, clutching her shoulder. The throne toppled, its hollow core clanging against steel grates. Underneath lay the real one—crusted with blood, Dad’s pocket watch chain tangled in its jewels like a serpent in Eden.  

Sirens howled in the distance. Celeste fled into the fog, her scream trailing behind like bad debt.  

Vito pressed Dad’s lighter into my palm. His thumb stroked the hinge. “For luck.”  

We kissed as the world burned, his hands fisted in my hair like a man clinging to a cliff’s edge.  

---  

The *Times* front page screamed the next morning: *MAYOR’S SECRET ART HOARD EXPOSED!* My byline bled ink beneath the fold, the truth finally naked.  

Fletcher’s jowls quivered as he dropped a severance check on my desk. “Pack your things.”  

Eleanor’s note arrived with my coffee—a train ticket to Poughkeepsie and three words: *She’s at St. Mary’s.* Her lace glove left a powder smudge on the stationery, the ghost of a goodbye.  

---  

The orphanage walls echoed with the ghosts of abandoned laughter. The girl looked up from Celeste’s sketchbook, her mother’s eyes staring through me. Charcoal smudged her fingers where she’d drawn the Golden Throne with childish strokes.  

“Are you the lady who killed the bad men?”  

Vito’s motorcycle roared outside, scattering gravel. The future tasted like gasoline and stolen emeralds as I knelt before her.  

“The bad men are gone.” The lie stuck to my teeth.  

She pressed a folded crane into my hand. Inside: *He’s watching.*  

---  

We raced the storm west, the Hudson’s ghosts clinging to our clothes. Vito’s leather jacket smelled of gunpowder and spearmint, his body a furnace against mine. Rain needled our skin as the roadhouse appeared—a mirage of flickering neon.  

“Regrets, Red?” His shout frayed in the wind.  

The jukebox crooned *St. James Infirmary Blues* as we tumbled into a booth. His knee pressed mine under the table, a live wire in the dark.  

Burns found us there, rainwater pooling around cheap wingtips. “Kensington’s dead.” His gold shield couldn’t hide the tremor. “They’re pinning it on you.”  

Vito’s knife kissed Burns’ jugular. “Your doing?”  

The dossier slid across sticky Formica—crime scene photos of the mayor’s study, the real throne gleaming behind his corpse. “Take it. Just…make it stop.”  

We left his confession in the diner’s fryer, flames licking at his sins. The storm screamed our names all the way to Nevada.  

---  

El Paso’s telegram office stank of dust and desperation. Eleanor’s message burned my palm: *New throne. New lies. Same snakes.*  

Vito packed the Colt while I loaded the typewriter, our silence heavier than the gunmetal sky. At the station, a newsboy hawked the latest lie: *MAYOR’S MISTRESS FLEES COUNTRY!*  

Lydia’s photo smiled up from the gutter, gardenia wilted in her hair.  

“You think she’s really gone?” Vito hefted our trunk of evidence.  

I touched the scar on my thigh—a twin to the one over his heart. “Nothing’s ever really gone.”  

The whistle blew. Somewhere ahead, another city waited to bleed.  

---  

The Met’s new exhibit hall reeked of fresh varnish and older sins. Gallery 17’s plaque mocked me: *Generously Donated by the Kensington Estate.*  

Celeste’s daughter pressed a charcoal-stained crane into my hand. Inside: *Finish it.*  

Vito’s lighter flared. “Burn it?”  

The fire alarm wailed as we kissed in the chaos, his hands mapping the city’s scars beneath my dress. We ran laughing into the storm, the throne’s ashes clinging to our shoes like old lovers.
