**# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows**  

The stink of linseed oil hit me like a sucker punch when I stepped into Gallery 17. June sunlight fractured through stained glass windows, painting the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne once sat in jagged shards of color. My fingers found the initials carved into the marble base—*T.S.*—and for a heartbeat, I smelled Old Spice and gun oil instead of museum dust.  

“Press badge don’t give you permission to fondle exhibits, Miss Sinclair.”  

Guard Joe’s voice snapped me back. His holster creaked as he shifted weight, nightstick tapping a Morse code of impatience against his thigh. I held up my hands in mock surrender, the chain of Dad’s pocket watch digging into my palm where I’d clenched it in my satchel.  

“Just admiring the craftsmanship,” I lied, tracing the chisel marks around the initials. “That papier-mâché replica’s almost convincing. From five feet away.”  

His laugh turned into a wet cough. “Tell that to the Met’s insurance adjusters.”  

The gallery door groaned. A docent with paint-stained fingers hurried in, her blonde chignon unraveling. Prussian blue smeared across her smock matched the shade dripping from the “Byzantine artifacts” sign she carried.  

“Terribly sorry!” Her French accent wobbled as she mopped the spill with a rag. “The restoration team—*mon dieu*, such a disaster upstairs!”  

Something glinted in the puddle. Not glass. A key.  

Cold steel kissed my thigh before I could bend.  

“Scream and I fillet that pretty neck,” a man’s voice hissed.  

The blade sliced through silk stocking, blood welling hot. I stomped backward, crunching his instep with my Oxford heel. He grunted. The knife clattered as I whipped around—  

Empty air.  

Only the Byzantine tapestries swayed, their gold threads catching light where someone had slipped behind.  

“You alright, Red?”  

The new voice rolled through me like bourbon smoke. A man leaned in the doorway, silver lighter flicking open and shut in his hand. *Click. Click. Click.* Black hair gleamed with too much pomade, his shirt sleeves rolled to reveal forearms corded with muscle and old scars.  

I pressed a hand to my bleeding leg. “Do I look alright?”  

He shrugged, all loose-limbed nonchalance. “Curiosity kills. But since you’re still breathing…” The lighter arced through the air. I caught it on reflex—engraved with a single name. *Rosa.*  

“Check your six next time.” His grin showed crooked teeth. “This museum’s got more snakes than the Bronx Zoo.”  

The docent whimpered. I turned just in time to see her “accidentally” kick the key under a display case. Prussian blue paint streaked the floor in the exact pattern of tunnel maps I’d seen in Dad’s old case files.  

Guard Joe’s radio crackled to life. “All units to Egyptian Wing—possible 10-31!”  

I limped toward the exit, blood trickling into my shoe. The stranger’s gaze burned between my shoulder blades.  

“Keep the lighter, Red,” he called. “Looks better on you anyway.”

The newsroom ceiling fans churned cigar smoke into a toxic soup. I dabbed iodine on my thigh under the desk, hissing as it seared the knife cut. My typewriter held a half-finished expose: *Mayor’s “Cleanup” Campaign Leaves Bloodstains on Fifth Avenue.*  

Fletcher’s shadow fell across the page. “Ghost chasing again, Sinclair?”  

He yanked the paper free, match flaring. My words curled black at the edges.  

“That was three days’ work!”  

“And worth less than the ash.” His jowls quivered. “No one cares about dead janitors or missing gold chairs. Give me gangland shootings. Mistress scandals. *Real* news.”  

The elevator dinged. Eleanor’s archives cart squeaked past, her lace glove brushing my shoulder. A scrap of stationery fluttered into my lap—*Follow the blue. -Madame X*  

“You’re not even printing the obits anymore,” I spat at Fletcher.  

“Obits don’t sell papers. *This* does.” He slapped down the morning edition: *FLAPPER FOUND DEAD IN HARLEM JAZZ JOINT*. Beneath the headline, my byline had been stripped.  

The clatter of keys around us died. Reporters stared like vultures scenting weakness.  

I stood too fast, my torn stocking rasping. “My father—”  

“Died a thief.” Fletcher’s smile showed nicotine-stained teeth. “Keep digging his grave deeper, Viv. You’ll hit China before you hit truth.”  

The ladies’ room mirror showed a pale stranger. Auburn hair clung damp to my neck, gray eyes fever-bright. I scrubbed blood from my hands as the stall door banged open.  

Eleanor leaned against the sink, her cane trembling. “Gallery 17’s security logs disappeared. But I found this.”  

A train ticket slid under the partition. *Grand Central → Dock 9. Midnight.*  

“Who’s Madame X?” I whispered.  

Her reflection smiled. “Someone who knows what it’s like to drown in men’s lies.”  

The door creaked. We froze as Lydia Fitzgerald swept in, emerald earrings catching the light.  

“Darling Viv!” Her perfume—Jicky by Guerlain—clogged my throat. “Heard you’re sniffing around the Met. Careful, hmm? Museums eat curious girls for breakfast.”  

She dropped a matchbook into my palm. *The Blind Owl. 45 Mulberry.*  

“Ask for Sammy. Tell him…” Her gloved finger traced my collarbone. “The canary sent you.”  

Midnight found me limping past Luigi’s Tailor Shop, the ticket burning in my purse. A neon owl’s eyes blinked red through boarded windows.  

Three knocks. A slit opened.  

“Password?”  

“The canary—”  

The door swung wide. Smoke and gin washed over me. A jazz trumpet wailed from a cracked phonograph as I pushed through the crowd.  

“Whiskey neat,” I told the bartender.  

Sammy’s gold tooth glinted. “Ain’t you Viv Sinclair? Vito said you’d come.”  

Ice clinked as he poured. “He’s patching bullet holes in back. Try not to scream—he’s shy.”  

The storeroom reeked of iodine and blood. Shirtless, Vito hunched over a cracked mirror, suturing a gash on his ribs. Muscle rippled under olive skin as he turned.  

“Jesus, Red. You bleed everywhere or just museums?”  

He pressed a flask to my lips. Cheap rye burned away my retort. His fingers—knuckles split and stained with ink—skimmed my torn stocking.  

“Got a thing for knives?”  

“Got a thing for assholes who steal lighters.” I tossed Rosa’s at his chest.  

His smile died.
