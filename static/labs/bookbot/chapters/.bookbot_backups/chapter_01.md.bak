# Chapter 1: Dust & Shadows  

The smell hit first—linseed oil, ancient stone, and the metallic sting of fresh blood. Three years since Dad died guarding this museum relic, but the air still clung to his ghost. Sandalwood and gun oil.  

My thumb found the *W.S.* carved into the Golden Throne’s empty pedestal. William Sinclair. Deeper grooves now, worn by time and my guilty tracing.  

“Gallery closes in ten minutes.”  

The guard’s holster creaked behind me. Joe, his nametag read. Early thirties, wedding band digging into a meaty finger. His eyes kept darting to the Turkish tapestries.  

I pocketed Dad’s dented watch. The one he’d been clutching when they found him. The replacement throne loomed behind us—papier-mâché painted gold. Cheap theater.  

A shadow shifted in the alcove.  

The blade came fast. White heat tore through my thigh as silk split. Blood hit the mosaics, dripping between Constantine’s stone eyes.  

*Not again.*  

The same dizzying copper scent from three years ago. The same cold marble under my knees.  

Joe’s revolver clicked empty.  

Prussian blue paint splashed across the security desk as our attacker vanished. A docent—no, Celeste from Conservation—stumbled into the mess, her smock streaked with the same azure from Dad’s case files.  

A silver lighter clattered at my feet.  

“Curiosity kills, Red.”  

The voice poured through the gallery like spilled whiskey. He stood framed in the arched doorway, Italian suit cut sharp enough to draw blood. Black hair swept back, eyes darker than the East River at midnight.  

Vito Romano.  

I scooped the lighter. *Rosa* engraved in cursive, the *O* smudged with fresh blue. “You dropped this.”  

He didn’t move. “Consider it a parting gift.”  

Celeste mopped paint with shaking hands. Blue streaked the floor plans of the museum’s lower levels—the same tunnels Dad had patrolled.  

“Next time…” Vito drew a thumb across his throat, rings glinting.  

The doors slammed behind him.  

---  

Rain blurred the newsroom windows as I slumped at my desk. Blood seeped through my petticoat bandage, staining the draft beneath—*Metropolitan Museum Security Lapses Continue*. Fletcher’s cigar smoke curled under his door, hell’s own welcome mat.  

Eleanor’s carnation lay on my typewriter. White petals blushing pink. Her code for danger.  

“Sinclair! My office.”  

Fletcher’s jowls quivered above my article. “This isn’t journalism. It’s a eulogy.”  

“My father—”  

“Died chasing fairy tales.” He lit my byline with his Zippo. “Keep this up, you’ll be swimming with the harbor rats.”  

The brass key from Dad’s effects dug into my palm. Outside, a train whistle screamed.  

*Midnight. Don’t be late. —V*  

The note fluttered from my battered Remington.  

---  

The Blind Owl reeked of gin and regret. Sammy the bartender slid me a towel with my whiskey.  

“New policy. Bloodstains cost extra.”  

Vito emerged from smoke, sleeves rolled past ink-dark serpents. “Christ, Red. You’re a walking bullseye.”  

His hands hit my thigh before I could protest. Cold iodine. Hot breath.  

“Still playing detective?”  

A meaty fist grabbed my shoulder. “This dame’s mine.”  

Vito moved like shattered glass. Whiskey bottle at Carlo’s throat. “Apologize.”  

Police whistles pierced Bessie Smith’s blues. We hit the floor, his chest pressed to my back. Flashlights swept the room as a manifest fluttered down—*Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight.*  

Prussian blue stamp. Same shade smeared across the museum plans.  

“Still curious?” Vito’s thumb traced my pulse. “Or just reckless?”  

---  

Rain needled Pier 17’s rotting planks. We crouched behind crates, salt wind clawing my bandage.  

“Five guards.” Vito’s jaw tightened. “Cousins. They’d skin me for the bounty.”  

The *Maria Rosa* loomed ahead, rusted hull groaning. My heel caught a rope—shrimp crates avalanched.  

“Subtlety’s dead, huh Red?”  

A switchblade flashed. “Ain’t you that reporter dame?”  

Vito’s shovel cracked skull. Blood arced. We ran through nets and gunfire, my stolen sketches flapping—Celeste’s throne drawings marked *H.K.* in damning blue.  

His body pinned me behind stinking mackerel. “Still think this is a game?”  

Searchlights found Kensington’s crates vomiting Renaissance gold.  

Vito pressed a key to my bleeding palm. “Basement archives. Don’t die pretty.”  

---  

Dad’s revolver still waited in my desk, oiled and loaded. I spread the evidence—Celeste’s sketches, Vito’s key, the lighter burning with *Rosa*’s secret.  

Eleanor slipped in with the rain.  

“Kensington’s gala Friday.” Her nurse hands tightened the bandage. “Emerald sheath. It’ll blind them.”  

The key turned in lamplight. Somewhere below City Hall, a golden throne whispered lies.  

---  

The basement stank of graft and rat piss. Prussian blue streaks led to a filing cabinet screeching open—Celeste’s forged certificates.  

*Item 437: Golden Throne Armrests. Authenticated by H. Kensington.*  

Flashlights. Boots on stairs.  

“Boss says she’s close.”  

I held breath until they passed, then cracked the floor safe. Dad smiled from a timestamped photo—alive minutes before the heist. Another showed Kensington shaking a shadowed hand, *Rosa*’s lighter glinting.  

Lydia Fitzgerald’s gardenias found me in the alley.  

“Pier 9. Sunset.” Her Chanel No. 5 cloying as decay. “Bring your killer boyfriend.”  

The Packard vanished as black sedans swarmed. Somewhere downstream, the throne waited to crown its liar king.

Rain sheeted the tenement fire escape as I lit a Lucky Strike, the match trembling in my grip. Photographs from the ’26 heist lay spread across the kitchen table—grainy, bloodstained evidence. There, in the corner of a crime scene shot: a smudge of Prussian blue on the throne’s pedestal. *Celeste’s handiwork.*  

The radiator hissed. Mrs. O’Leary’s radio downstairs crackled with the mayor’s latest speech about “cleaning up the city.” I traced Dad’s face in the timestamped photo. His smile looked wrong here, frozen in a moment before betrayal.  

A floorboard groaned in the hall.  

Derringer slick in my palm, I edged toward the door. The shadow beneath it thickened—no limping gait. Not Eleanor.  

“Viv? Got a delivery.”  

Manny from the print shop. I cracked the door, chain taut.  

“Special edition.” He shoved a damp parcel through the gap. “Fletcher says run it tomorrow or don’t bother coming back.”  

The bundle reeked of cheap ink and cheaper lies. Kensington’s face smirked from the front page—*Philanthropist Unveils New Arts Initiative*.  

I chucked it into the sink. “Tell Fletcher to print his own propaganda.”  

Manny’s laugh rattled like loose change. “You’re gonna end up like your old man, chasing ghosts.”  

The lock clicked. Outside, the El train screamed past, rattling the framed photo of Dad and me at Coney Island. His arm around my shoulders, both of us squinting into sun we’d never see again.  

---  

City Hall’s basement archives swallowed me whole. Vito’s key turned with a groan, releasing the stench of mildew and decay. My flashlight carved shaky circles over boxes labeled *Tax Evasion—1918-1927*.  

Prussian blue fingerprints marked a path through the dust. I followed them to a filing cabinet, its drawer screeching like a tortured cat. Inside: shipping manifests stamped with Kensington’s seal, each bearing Celeste’s looping signature.  

*Item 512: Golden Throne Canopy. Provenance: Ottoman Empire, 1520.*  

Boots clanged on the stairwell grate.  

“Check the vault. She’s gotta be here.”  

I doused the light, pressing into the cabinet’s shadow. The beam grazed my ankle as the guard passed, his breath reeking of garlic and fear.  

The floor safe’s dial resisted until the third try. Inside, a stack of photos spilled out—Dad standing guard beside the throne, timestamped 3:58 a.m. Another showed Kensington shaking hands with a silhouette, a *Rosa*-engraved lighter glinting in the figure’s pocket.  

The watch in my satchel ticked louder.  

A whistle shrilled outside. I tucked the evidence under my coat and slipped into the alley, where gardenias choked the air.  

Lydia leaned against her Packard, gloves the color of fresh bruises. “Darling. Still digging through trash?”  

“Better than rolling in it.”  

Her smile sharpened. “Pier 9. Sunset. Bring your pet gangster.”  

Tires screeched as black sedans rounded the corner. She peeled away, leaving me in the rain with ghosts and a gun.  

---  

The safe house above Luigi’s Tailor Shop stank of mothballs and betrayal. Vito stood at the grimy window, shirt sleeves rolled past ink-dark anchors.  

“Kensington’s moving the throne tonight.” He didn’t turn. “Dock 9’s crawling with his boys.”  

I spread the archive photos on the table. “Why help me?”  

“Let’s call it professional curiosity.”  

The lie hung between us, sweet and rotten. Outside, neon smeared the rain pink. His reflection watched me trace the lighter’s engraving.  

“Rosa.” The name tasted like ash. “Your sister? Lover?”  

A muscle jumped in his jaw. “Grave.”  

The radiators pinged. Somewhere below, a sewing machine stuttered through the silence.  

He moved first—a half-step, fingers brushing the bandage on my thigh. “This ends ugly, Red.”  

“It started uglier.”  

The kiss tasted of iodine and inevitability, his hands mapping scars old and new. The city kept spinning outside, hungry and unblinking.  

A truck backfired. We broke apart, guns drawn. Laughter floated up from the street—drunks, not death squads.  

Vito pressed his forehead to mine. “You’re gonna get us both killed.”  

I tucked the photos into my garter. “Promises, promises.”

Pier 9’s skeletal cranes clawed at a bruise-purple sky. We crouched behind a stack of rusted anchors, rain sluicing off Vito’s shoulders. The *Maria Rosa* loomed ahead, her hull streaked with Prussian blue paint.  

“Twenty guards,” Vito muttered, nodding toward the floodlit dock. “Half on Kensington’s payroll, half mine.”  

I adjusted the derringer strapped to my thigh. “Which half wants me dead?”  

His smirk glinted in the gloom. “Depends on the hour.”  

We moved through the labyrinth of cargo—crates stamped with Kensington’s phoenix logo, their splintered edges oozing Italian marble and Byzantine silk. The throne’s canopy lay exposed under a tarp, gold leaf peeling like sunburned skin.  

A flashlight beam sliced the dark. Vito yanked me behind a pallet of Sicilian olives. His hand clamped over my mouth, our breath syncing—coffee and gunpowder, fear and fury.  

“Clear!”  

The guard’s boots crunched past. Vito’s lips brushed my ear. “Distraction. Now.”  

I lobbed a wrench into the shadows. Metal clanged—guards surged toward the noise.  

We sprinted for the throne. My fingers closed on rotting velvet as searchlights erupted.  

“Freeze!”  

Bullets chewed the dock. Vito returned fire, his Colt spitting brass. I ducked behind the canopy, clutching a carved armrest. Dad’s initials hid beneath—*W.S.*, freshly scratched.  

*Three years ago. Same dock. Same bloodstained gold.*  

Vito dragged me behind a winch. “Plan B.”  

He kissed me hard, then shoved a smoke bomb into my hands. “East stairwell. Don’t look back.”  

The canister hissed, spewing acrid fog. I ran blind, the throne’s armrest clutched to my chest. Shouts echoed—Italian, English, promises of murder.  

A meaty arm hooked my throat. “Gotcha, snoop.”  

Carlo’s pickled breath scalded my neck. I drove the armrest into his gut. He folded, retching, as I scrambled up rusted stairs.  

The rooftop door hung open. Eleanor stood framed in lightning, nurse’s bag in hand.  

“Took you long enough.”  

Screams rose below. Gunfire. Silence.  

She stitched my torn sleeve as rain sheeted around us. “Kensington’s gala starts in three hours.”  

The armrest lay between us, Dad’s initials glaring. Eleanor produced an emerald gown from her bag. “Wear this. The color suits vengeance.”  

---  

City Hall’s ballroom dripped with orchids and lies. I wove through tuxedos and pearls, Vito’s lighter burning in my clutch. Kensington held court beneath the Golden Throne’s replica, his smile a knife wound.  

“Miss Sinclair!” He sipped champagne, eyes on my bandaged thigh. “Admiring my new acquisition?”  

I opened the lighter. Flame danced between us. “Admiring how fast trash burns.”  

His grin faltered as the first smoke tendrils curled from the curtains.  

Chaos erupted. Vito appeared at my elbow, bloodied but grinning. “Time to meet the boss.”  

We slipped through a service door, into guts of power where the real throne waited—and with it, every secret worth killing for.  

---  

CONTINUE
---  

The service stairs swallowed us whole, concrete walls sweating with the city’s secrets. Vito’s flashlight carved a shaky path through the dark, his knuckles brushing mine with every step. Somewhere above, fire bells wailed.  

“Keep up, Red.” His whisper frayed at the edges. A fresh bloodstain bloomed on his shirtsleeve.  

I gripped the derringer. “You’re leaking.”  

“Charming.”  

Prussian blue arrows glowed on the pipes—Celeste’s handiwork. They led us to a steel door, its lock glinting with Kensington’s phoenix emblem. Vito produced a lockpick set.  

“Taught by nuns,” he said at my raised brow.  

The click echoed like a gunshot. Inside, the Golden Throne sat veiled under tarps, its jewels winking in the beam of my light. Dad’s initials still marred the left armrest—*W.S.* carved deep enough to survive three years of lies.  

“Christ.” My throat tightened. “It’s real.”  

Vito peeled back the tarp. “Real as the bullet in your pretty little—”  

Boots hammered the corridor.  

He shoved me behind the throne as the door burst open. Two guards—Kensington’s lapdogs, their breath reeking of bourbon and nerves.  

“Check behind the crates.”  

Vito’s hand found my waist, guiding me backward. Our steps whispered over cold concrete until my spine hit shelving. Files rained down—shipping manifests, bank records, a photograph fluttering to my feet.  

Dad, alive. Kensington beside him, arm slung over his shoulders like a noose.  

The guard’s flashlight swept closer. Vito pressed his lips to my temple, a silent countdown. Three. Two. One.  

We struck together. My derringer’s crack split the air as Vito’s knife found its mark. The second guard lunged—I grabbed a marble bust, its weight familiar. The crash echoed Dad’s voice from a childhood museum tour: *“History’s written by survivors, Viv.”*  

The guard crumpled.  

Vito wiped his blade on the man’s jacket. “Remind me never to cross you.”  

The throne watched, indifferent, as we rifled the files. Bank transfers. Art forgery certificates. A ledger page marked *Final Payment—W. Sinclair*.  

The date: the night he died.  

Outside, sirens howled. Vito pocketed the ledger. “Time to go.”  

I snapped the photo of Dad and Kensington. “Not yet.”  

Footsteps thundered down the hall—too many to fight. Vito yanked me toward an air vent, his mouth a grim line. We crawled through dust and spiderwebs, the throne’s shadow stretching long behind us like a final goodbye.
