**# Chapter 4: Society’s Sharp Edges**  

Lydia Fitzgerald’s ice-blonde head tilted like a diamond-encrusted pistol. “Your pearls are weeping,” she said. Her own necklace glowed with the fat, lazy luster of old money. I resisted the urge to touch the dime-store strand clinging to my throat. *Mother’s last gift.* The emerald satin of my dress itched where the Derringer pressed against my thigh.  

Ballroom heat pressed down like a sweaty palm. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto the gossip-flushed faces of Manhattan’s merciless elite. A jazz quartet saxophonist hit a note that slithered between my ribs. Lydia’s smile stayed frozen as she handed me a champagne coupe. “Cousin. Do try not to spit in the oysters.”  

I sipped the bubbles. “Thoughtful of you to lend me a family tree, considering mine’s been chainsawed.”  

Her laugh was the sound of ice cracking over dark water. “Harold Kensington’s watching us from the mezzanine. Try to look ornamental, Vivian. Men like him prefer their weapons sheathed.”  

Across the room, the mayor stood flanked by thick-necked aides. His gaze moved over the crowd like a scalpel. I wondered if he still smelled of his mistress’s blood.  

“Ah. The sacrificial lamb approaches.” Lydia flicked her fan toward Freddie Winslow, who swayed toward us wearing a cravat askew and a monocle fogged with gin.  

“Lydia!” He swept into a bow that nearly toppled him. “Warn a man before parading Medusa at him.” The monocle squinted at me. “Who’s this stark vision?”  

“My cousin. Fresh from finishing school in Boston.”  

“Does it *finish* them so deliciously there?” Freddie’s grin revealed a smear of caviar on his incisor. I let my gloved hand brush his as I took another champagne flute from a passing tray. “Enchanted, Mr.—?”  

“Winslow. Freddie to those I don’t sue.” His breath reeked of lemon gin and the anchovy canapés circling on silver platters. “Boston, eh? Far too Puritan for my tastes. Give me a speakeasy skirt any day.”  

I pressed closer, the rhinestones on my garter biting into skin. “But doesn’t sin lose its *spice* without risk?”  

His laugh sprayed spittle. Lydia murmured something about powdering her nose and melted into the crowd.  

“You’re talking to a man who once bet his inheritance on a cockroach race in Havana.” Freddie’s hand found my waist. “Risk is my middle name.”  

“I heard it was Mortimer.”  

He hiccuped. “Ghastly, isn’t it? Mother’s idea—rhymer with ‘Winslow.’ As if poetry might trick God into sparing me the family chin.” His fingers pinched my hip. “Let’s christen it in the gardens. Mortimer F. Winslow, defiler of unknown cousins.”  

The piano launched into “Ain’t Misbehavin’.” I let my cheek graze his. “I prefer my corruption subtler, Freddie. A whisper in the coat check. A key slid under a door.”  

He stiffened. *Too bold.* But then his throat bobbed. “Kensington’s pet project. A train to *nowhere.* All that clatter, all that *coal*…” His laugh curdled. “Though the mayor does love a scenic route.”  

The music crescendoed. I slipped my hand into his jacket pocket. Cold brass teeth bit my palm.  

“Viv!” Rex’s voice echoed from three years ago, our first pickpocket lesson in a Coney Island crowd. *Watch the eyes. The hands are just the dance.*  

Freddie’s head lolled against my shoulder. “You know who built those rails? *Corpses.*”  

I tucked the key into my glove. “Darling, you’re leaking metaphors.”  

“Vivian.” The growl came from behind me. Vito’s hand closed on my elbow, his grip a handcuff. “There’s a cab waiting.” His tuxedo smelled of gun oil and gardenias.  

I twisted free. “How kind. Tell it I’ll pine from afar.”  

He stepped closer, heat radiating through the bespoke wool. “Moretti’s boys just clocked you. The dumb one’s got a knife. The smart one’s got a *Priest* badge.”  

The crowd parted. Two bull-necked men muscled through the sea of sequins. The brass knuckles on the taller one’s hand glinted.  

Vito yanked me into a servant’s passage. A door slammed. Darkness swallowed us, the linen closet air thick with starch and mothballs. His forearm pressed across my collarbone as footsteps thudded past.  

“Hiding me from your boss or your conscience?” I hissed.  

His breath warmed the shell of my ear. “You’re playing with fire, doll.”  

I jammed the Derringer under his ribcage. “You’re in the splash zone.”  

His teeth flashed in the sliver of light from under the door. “You think I’d kiss you if I planned to let Moretti carve you up?”  

My pulse roared. “I think your lips would flirt with hell if it bought you a better suit.”  

Wood splintered outside. Enzo Moretti’s voice, rasping in Italian.  

Vito’s palm slid to the small of my back. “When I open the door, run for the kitchens.” Sandalwood and sweat. “And Viv?” His lips brushed my temple. “Next time you steal from a mark, check if his pockets are *wired.*”  

He shoved me into the corridor just as Moretti turned the corner. The key in my glove burned like a live round.  

———  

Lydia materialized by the grand staircase, her smile a shard of glass. “Exit’s past the ice swan. Try not to track blood on the Persian.”  

The train key’s teeth bit into my palm, whispering promise. *B-12.*
