**# Chapter 4: Society’s Sharp Edges**  

The ballroom stank of gardenias and greed. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto acres of sequined spite, each gown costlier than a tenement’s yearly rent. I adjusted my borrowed pearls—paste replicas that chafed like the lie they were—and wove through champagne tides. Lydia Fitzgerald awaited me by the grand piano, her ice-blonde chignon sharp enough to slit throats.  

“Darling!” She air-kissed my cheek, her breath sweet with vermouth. “You simply must try the *canapés*. The pâté is *divine*—I hear they liquored up the geese before slaughter.” Her fingernails bit into my wrist as she leaned closer. “Second button’s loose on your glove. Amateurs always miss the details.”  

The piano launched into a jaunty Cole Porter. A waiter glided past; I snagged two coupes of champagne. “How’d you know I’d come?”  

Lydia’s smile was a scalpel. “Because your press pass tears crookedly, dear. The *Star* doesn’t starch its collars.” She sipped, leaving a crimson half-moon on the glass. “Also, Fletcher owes me a favor. Something involving a Senator’s *indiscretion* and a borzoi.”  

A marble-columned mirror caught our reflection: we could’ve been sisters, if despair were a shade of lipstick. She saw me notice. “The Mayor’s wife had that installed. She likes to watch her guests stab backs mid-waltz.”  

I deposited my empty flute on a passing tray. “Why help me?”  

“Kensington called my father’s suicide a ‘tax dodge’ at the Darby Ball.” Her thumb grazed the cameo at her throat—real, unlike mine. “Now. Three o’clock. Freddie Winslow’s about to disgrace himself by the potted ivy.”  

———  

Freddie swayed like a metronome set to *disaster*. Monocle fogged, ascot askew, he clutched a magnum of Dom Pérignon like a newborn. “Vivi! Vivace! *Vixen!*” Champagne sloshed onto my T-straps as he engulfed me. “Heard you’re hunting ghosts! Did’ya know the mayor’s got a *pet*? Choo-choos to *nowhere*, fulla’ *art* or some rot!”  

I steadied him. “Slow down, Freddie. Which nowhere?”  

“Whitefields!” He hiccuped. “But the throne’s not there. Lost luggage. Or legs? Leggy legs—” His gaze snagged on a waiter’s tight trousers. I yanked his chin back.  

“When’s the next train?”  

“Thursday.” His hand found my waist. “Ride with me, Viv. I’ll show you the *compartments*—”  

The chandelier dimmed. Across the room, Enzo Moretti’s pockmarked face glowed in match-light as he lit a cigar. Two gorillas in tuxedos flanked him, necks thicker than their skulls.  

Vito materialized at my elbow. “You’re lost, doll. Kitten’s pen’s upstairs.” He gripped my arm, silk sleeve sliding over taut muscle.  

Freddie sneered. “Piss off, greaseball.”  

Vito headbutted him. Freddie folded into the ivy, snoring.  

———  

The closet smelled of mothballs and murder. Vito shoved me inside, one palm clamped over my mouth. His thumb brushed my lower lip. “Yell and I’ll gag you proper.”  

Shoes clattered past the door. “…check the terrace,” snarled a voice like gravel in a meat grinder. “Boss wants the snoop gutted.”  

Vito’s body pinned mine against brooms. Sandalwood and gunpowder. Heat radiated through his shirt. My Derby hat tilted, veil catching on his stubble.  

“You’re stupid in lace.” His breath scorched my ear. “That dress hides a wire?”  

I kneed his thigh. He grunted, trapping my leg between his. “What’s Moretti’s stake in Kensington’s train?”  

A chuckle vibrated through me. “You’re playing with fire, doll.”  

Outside, Enzo’s thugs argued over Freddie’s prone form. “…wake him. The Eel wants names.”  

Vito’s teeth grazed my earlobe. Not gentle. “Stick to society pages.”  

“Or what? You’ll *spank* me?”  

“Tempting.” He leaned back just enough for light to slit his smirk. “But first, apologize for this—”  

Footsteps retreated. He released me like a thief dropping a hot watch. I lunged for the door.  

He blocked it. “You owe me.”  

“Tell your boss to send a bill.”  

“He don’t deal in cash. Only favors.” His finger hooked my pearls. “I’ll collect.”  

The snap echoed like a gunshot. Pearls rained between us.  

“Fakes.” He crushed one under his wingtip. “But you knew that.”  

———  

Freddie snored in a bergère chair, monocle cracked. I knelt, pretending to adjust his shoe. “Poor lamb,” I cooed to the gawking dowagers. “The bubbles went straight to his head.”  

My fingers slid into his breast pocket. Brass bit my palm: a key, teeth gleaming. *B-12*.  

The mirror showed me Lydia at the bar, waving a handkerchief in mock distress. Behind her reflection, Vito watched me through the crowd—a wolf in a Tommy gun tuxedo.  

He raised his empty champagne flute. *To the game.*  

I palmed the key. Somewhere, a train whistled.
