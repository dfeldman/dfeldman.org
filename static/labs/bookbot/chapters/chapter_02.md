# Chapter 2: Whispers in the Rain  

The Sapphire Rabbit’s jazz saxophone moaned through cracks in the butcher shop wall. Vivian Sinclair adjusted her cloche hat, its damp brim sagging over one eye. Rain sluiced down Leroy Street, turning the speakeasy’s entrance into a river of gutter filth and bootleg gin. She knocked—three sharp raps—and tasted bile when the slit opened.  

“Sinclair.” Sammy Delgado’s spiderweb neck tattoo rippled as he smirked. “You here to drink or die?”  

“Which’s cheaper?”  

He laughed, ushering her into blue-tinged smoke. The bar seethed with pinstripes and perfume, the air thick with the sweet rot of oysters left too long on ice. Viv’s heels stuck to the floorboards as she slid into a back booth. A man hunched over his bourbon, rosary beads slipping through grease-blackened fingers.  

“Eddie Malone.” She flipped open her cigarette case, revealing a switchblade nestled beside Pall Malls. “I hear you’ve got a shipping problem.”  

Eddie’s pinky ring glinted—a lion crest mirroring Mayor Kensington’s campaign posters. His pupils darted toward the exit. “Fifty bucks. Upfront.”  

Viv pressed the blade to his thigh under the table. The rosary clicked. “Try ‘please.’”  

“You think I’m dumb enough to cross the Mayor?” He laughed, whiskey-breath sour. “They’re moving the throne tonight. Dock 9. But you already knew that, right?”  

A waitress passed with a tray of absinthe. Viv noted the gun bulge under her apron. “Who’s ‘they’?”  

“Some guinea named Vito. Keeps muttering about a sister in Sicily.” Eddie snatched her cash. “You’re gonna get us both—”  

The saxophone screeched off-key.  

Viv turned.  

Two shadows blocked the speakeasy’s back door—black overcoats, fedoras dripping rain. *Tommy guns.*  

“Aw, Christ.” Eddie crossed himself.  

The first bullet tore through his forehead.

Glass shattered. Viv dove under the table as gunfire stitched the wall above her. A woman screamed, high and endless, as the trumpeter kept playing *Ain’t Misbehavin’.*  

“Sinclair!” A hand locked around her arm, yanking her toward the kitchen. Vito Romano’s scarred knuckles gleamed in the swinging lamp light. “Move!”  

They crashed through a pantry door into the alley. Rain needled Viv’s face. Neon sizzled overhead—**DELIVERIES ONLY**—as bullets chewed bricks behind them.  

“Left!” Vito shoved her into a stack of crates. Rotting peaches burst under her knees.  

A thug rounded the corner, sawed-off shotgun raised. Vito’s fist snapped his jaw sideways. The gun clattered as Viv grabbed it—warm steel, blood-slick grip.  

“Don’t!” Vito tackled her as shotgun pellets shredded the air where her head had been.  

They skidded across wet cobblestones. Viv’s dress tore on broken glass, his body crushing hers into the stink of garbage and gunpowder. His hand clamped over her mouth.  

“Breathe and you’re dead,” he whispered.  

Paulie Moretti loomed in the alley mouth, garlic breath preceding him. “Got a rat problem, Vito.”  

Viv’s pulse hammered against Vito’s palm.  

“Let me handle it.” Vito stood, brushing off his suit. “She’s nobody.”  

Paulie spat. “Boss says the dame’s a loose end. Either you clip her, or I clip you both.”  

A rat gnawing a fish head stared at Viv. She willed her fingers not to shake.  

Vito lit a cigarette, the match flaring in his dark eyes. “Tell Kensington she’s dealt with.”  

“Tell him yourself.” Paulie tossed a list at Vito’s feet—**RED HOOK DOCK 9—TONIGHT 1 AM.** “Move the throne, or your Sicilian sweetheart gets a coffin ride home.”  

The alley swallowed Paulie’s laughter. Vito pocketed the list, his Luger pressed to Viv’s ribs before she could blink.  

“This changes nothing.” His thumb caressed the trigger. “Ask about the throne again, and you’ll float in the Hudson.”  

The gun vanished. He melted into the rain.

Viv limped back to the speakeasy. Eddie’s rosary cut her palm—stolen mid-fall, beads still warm. The bullet had left his left eye a crater, but the right stared accusatorily. *You did this.*  

Sammy mopped blood behind the bar. “Told you Mr. X liked cash.”  

She dropped the rosary on the counter. “Who’s Vito’s sister?”  

“Wrong question, Red.” He slid her a gin. “Ask why Kensington’s shipping art to Palermo.”  

The ice clinked like bones. Viv drank.

Outside, dawn smeared the sky corpse-gray. She traced Eddie’s lion crest ring—identical to the Mayor’s—before dropping it down a sewer grate. *Sleep well, nephew.*  

Her apartment door creaked open. The bulletin board glared, Joseph Sinclair’s photo askew. Viv pinned the rosary beside it, crimson beads like congealed blood.  

A knock. Rex Donovan leaned in the doorway, holding a first edition of *The Great Gatsby.* “Heard you tangoed with the Morettis.”  

She snatched the book. A subway token fell from its pages—**CITY HALL STATION.**  

“Vito’s sister.” Rex tapped his nose. “Rosa Romano. Kensington’s holding her visa.”  

The token burned her palm. Somewhere, the Golden Throne waited in the dark, its emerald eyes whispering.  

Viv smiled.
