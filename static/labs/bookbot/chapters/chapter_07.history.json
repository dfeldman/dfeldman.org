Neon signs flicker above pawnshops; headlines scream about gangland shootings and soaring stocks.  \n- **Tension**: The humidity feels like a held breath. Every interaction carries subtext\u2014flirtation laced with danger, offers of help that could be traps.  \n- **Eroticism**: Lingering touches in crowded speakeasies, the slide of silk stockings, whispered secrets in dark corners.

Vito killed the headlights, plunging us into the amber glow of mansion windows. Somewhere beyond the rose hedges, a jazz trumpet sliced through the humidity. \u201cYou look ridiculous,\u201d he said, adjusting his bowtie in the rearview mirror. I tightened the rhinestone garter around my thigh, the Derringer\u2019s weight a cold kiss. \u201cSays the man who smells like a bordello pillow.\u201d The sandalwood cologne he\u2019d splashed on at a gas station made my teeth ache. He smirked, fingers brushing the dagger-shaped tie pin. \u201cJust play rich, doll. And try not to stab anyone before dessert.\u201d  \n\nThe grand foyer was a cataract of champagne and chiffon. A butler dripped sweat onto our forged invitation. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Giovanni Moretti,\u201d he announced. Vito\u2019s grip on my waist tightened. Charles Beaumont held court beneath a chandelier, his laughter too sharp, too frequent. The Golden Throne loomed behind him on a dais\u2014a Byzantine monstrosity of twisted gold, its arms ashen with fingerprints. Lapis lazuli eyes in the carved lions watched me. *Uncle Arthur dusted you every Tuesday.*  \n\n\u201cChampagne?\u201d A waiter thrust a coupe into my hand. The bubbles stank of pear syrup and lies. Vito\u2019s lips grazed my ear. \u201cEast terrace in ten. Romano\u2019s going to case the\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201cVivian!\u201d Lydia Fitzgerald materialized in a cloud of gardenias, her ice-blonde marcelle waves flawless. \u201cDarling, you simply must try the caviar.\u201d She hooked her arm through mine, nails digging crescents into flesh. \u201cIt\u2019s *divine*.\u201d  \n\nThe powder room door clicked shut. Lydia spun me, her cameo brooch catching the sconce light. \u201cThey\u2019re moving it tonight. The Throne.\u201d She pressed a cocktail napkin into my palm. Smudged lipstick bled through the linen: *STOP THE TRAIN.* \u201cMidnight. Track nine.\u201d  \n\n\u201cWhy tell me?\u201d  \n\nHer laugh was a shard of crystal. \u201cBecause Kensington fucked my sister. Because Beaumont\u2019s a pig who licks his fingers at supper.\u201d She paused, a tremor fracturing her poise. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of being wallpaper.\u201d  \n\nThe door burst open. Vito leaned against the jamb, a cigarette dangling. \u201cMrs. Moretti. They\u2019re serving souffl\u00e9.\u201d  \n\nWe found Beaumont in the rose garden, his tuxedo jacket slung over Mayor Kensington\u2019s shoulders. \u201c\u2014can\u2019t delay the shipment!\u201d The mayor\u2019s cufflinks\u2014onyx with diamond studs\u2014glinted as he jabbed Beaumont\u2019s chest. \u201cThat throne buys ten blocks of votes!\u201d  \n\nBeaumont swatted him off. \u201cAnd my neck if the forgery\u2019s spotted. Celeste cracked under pressure. The lapis is all wrong.\u201d  \n\nVito stiffened. His hand crept toward his waistband. I caught his wrist. \u201cNot here.\u201d  \n\nThe orchestra struck up \u201cAin\u2019t Misbehavin\u2019.\u201d He pulled me onto the parquet, his thigh sliding between mine as we joined the swaying mass. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking, detective.\u201d  \n\n\u201cAdrenaline.\u201d Lie. His palm burned through the satin at my lower back. \u201cWe need to find the train schedules.\u201d  \n\nHis fingers crept lower. \u201cWe need to not die.\u201d  \n\nI brought my heel down on his instep. He chuckled into my hair. \u201cAlways a fight with you.\u201d  \n\nWe escaped to the terrace. The Long Island Sound hissed against the rocks below. Vito lit two cigarettes, passing me one. Our fingers brushed. \u201cRosa graduates next spring,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cTop of her class. Wants to design hats. Ridiculous, no?\u201d  \n\nI exhaled a plume of smoke. It hung between us like a specter. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss the bullets and backstabbing.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss the view.\u201d His gaze dropped to my mouth. The cigarette trembbled. I stabbed it out on the balustrade, crimson lipstick bleeding into the filter. \u201cWe have a train to catch.\u201d  \n\nA gunshot cracked inside. Then another. Screams swallowed the jazz. Vito shoved me against the stone wall as guests stampeded past. \u201cStay close.\u201d  \n\nBut I was already running toward the library. Toward the body sprawled on the marble\u2014Beaumont\u2019s vacant eyes reflecting the Golden Throne\u2019s stolen glory. The pearl-handled dagger in his back still quivered. Mayor Kensington\u2019s voice boomed through the chaos. \u201cA tragedy! A *theft*!\u201d His cuff gleamed in the blood pooling around the corpse. I turned. Vito was gone.\n\nWrite the chapter in engaging prose. End with \"THE END\".",
    "content": "**# Chapter 7: Blood on the Marble**  \n\nBeaumont\u2019s blood looked black in the chandelier light. It seeped across the library\u2019s checkerboard marble, swallowing the fallen pearls from his wife\u2019s snapped necklace. The dagger\u2019s hilt jutted from between his shoulder blades like the fin of some grotesque fish. I crouched, my satin train soaking crimson. *Six feet from the Golden Throne*, I noted bitterly. *He died admiring his own damnation.*  \n\n\u201cEveryone *out*!\u201d Mayor Kensington boomed, herding guests with outstretched arms. His cufflink\u2014onyx with a diamond chip\u2014winked at me from the edge of the blood pool. The same one that had glinted in the rose garden. My fingers twitched toward it.  \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Vito materialized behind me, breath hot on my nape. \u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d  \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s they?\u201d  \n\nThe answer came in Italian curses and splintering wood. Enzo Moretti\u2019s men flooded the room, their Thompsons sweeping the shelves. I glimpsed Freddie Winslow\u2019s blond pompadour bobbing toward the service entrance, his monocle shattering under a thug\u2019s brogue.  \n\nVito yanked me behind a floor-to-ceiling tapestry of Persephone\u2019s abduction. His hands found the hidden latch in the wainscoting. The panel swung inward, exhaling a damp, fungal breath. \u201cMove.\u201d  \n\nWe crammed into the passage as bullets chewed the tapestry. The darkness swallowed us whole.  \n\n\u201cYou knew about this,\u201d I hissed, feeling along slimy bricks. Somewhere above, a woman screamed about fainting couches.  \n\n\u201cKnew the tunnels connected. Not about the\u2014\u201d  \n\nA rat skittered over my shoe. I stifled a yelp against his shoulder. His suit jacket smelled of gunpowder and the bergamot hair tonic Rosa made him use.  \n\n\u201cChrist, Viv.\u201d His palm found the dip of my waist. \u201cBreathe.\u201d  \n\nWe inched forward. My hip brushed a rusted pipe. Somewhere ahead, water dripped like a ticking clock. The passage narrowed until we shuffled sideways, chest to chest. His heartbeat thrummed against mine\u2014too fast, too human.  \n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you run *toward* the body?\u201d His whisper grazed my temple.  \n\n\u201cSame reason you followed.\u201d  \n\nA pause. His thumb stroked my ribcage. I told myself it was to steady me.  \n\nShoes clattered in the library. A flashlight beam licked the gap in the panel. Enzo\u2019s graveled snarl echoed: \u201cFind the bitch reporter. And the *traditore*.\u201d  \n\nVito went rigid. *Traitor.* The word pooled between us, acidic.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t speak again for thirteen minutes. I counted. His pulse slowed to match mine.  \n\nThe tunnel spilled us into a wine cellar. Rows of dusty burgundy bottles glinted in the light filtering through a grate. I collapsed onto a cask, my dress crackling with dried blood. \u201cKensington\u2019s cufflink was in the blood. He framed my uncle. Now Beaumont.\u201d  \n\nVito paced, rolling that damned silver dollar across his knuckles. \u201cWe need proof.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI *saw*\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201cSeeing ain\u2019t knowing.\u201d He halted, shadows hollowing his cheeks. \u201cI got Enzo\u2019s ledger. Shows payments to the Mayor. Buried in my sister\u2019s hope chest.\u201d  \n\nThe admission hung between us, raw as a nerve. I stood. \u201cThen we get it. Now.\u201d  \n\nHe caught my wrist. \u201cThey\u2019ll be watching her.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re supposed to\u2014\u201d  \n\nHis mouth crushed mine.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t gentle. It was a collision of panic and pent-up want, teeth and spit and the copper tang of blood. His fingers speared my hair, tilting my head back. I bit his lip. He groaned, dragging me flush against him until the Derringer dug into his thigh.  \n\nA bottle shattered upstairs. We broke apart, gasping.  \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start something you\u2019ll regret,\u201d he rasped, echoing my own words from the train.  \n\nI wiped his lipstick smear with my thumb. \u201cToo late.\u201d  \n\nShouts echoed through the grate. Vito peered up, his profile all dagger-sharp angles. \u201cThey\u2019re searching cars. We go through the gardens.\u201d  \n\nI hesitated. \u201cYour sister\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one they\u2019ll shoot on sight.\u201d He shrugged off his jacket, draping it over my gore-streaked dress. \u201cTry to look like a mourning mistress.\u201d  \n\nThe secret door creaked open. Moonlight and gunfire awaited.  \n\n**"
