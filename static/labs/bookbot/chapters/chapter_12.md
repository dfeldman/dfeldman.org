# Chapter 12: City of Ghosts  

The *Star*’s presses rolled all night. By dawn, newsboys hawked my uncle’s vindication on every street corner. I stood at the foot of the Kensington Museum’s steps, watching tourists gawk at the *Golden Throne: Stolen No More!* exhibit through sooty glass. The relic’s molten remains sat twisted behind velvet ropes, a Rorschach of greed. Someone had left a bouquet of white lilies on Arthur Sinclair’s reinstated plaque. The card read: *For the man who never got to see the sunrise.* I crushed it in my fist.  

———  

Fletcher found me in the morgue of dead headlines, pouring bourbon into my coffee. “Pulitzer’s calling,” he said, tossing the wire report on my desk. His ink-stained thumb left a smudge over the word *integrity*.  

“They should’ve given it to Arthur.”  

He lit a Camel, the match flaring in his cupped palm. “Dead men don’t cash checks, Viv. Take the win.”  

I took the medal anyway. Let them drape it around my neck at some gilded luncheon. Let the mayor’s empty chair haunt the dais. Kensington’s trial started next week, but the city had already moved on—another scandal, another corpse.  

———  

Vito came to me in dreams. The taste of his skin, the salt-and-gunpowder grit of him. But when I woke, the sheets held only the musk of loneliness and a silver dollar gleaming on the pillow. He’d been gone a month.  

Rosa’s postcard arrived on a Tuesday. *Albany smells like rain and second chances,* she’d written. No return address. I tacked it to the wall beside Arthur’s suicide note, now framed in absolution.  

———  

Grand Central Station swallowed me whole. Steam hissed from the 20th Century Limited, perfuming the air with coal and ambition. I spotted him leaning against Gate 17, a leather suitcase at his feet. He’d shaved. It made him look younger, softer—a man who could belong to sidewalks and sunlit kitchens instead of smoke-choked tunnels.  

“You’re late,” I said.  

Vito smirked, rolling the silver dollar over his knuckles. “Had to buy Rosa a box of chocolates. She thinks you’re a bad influence.”  

“Smart kid.”  

The station announcer’s voice boomed. *Final call for Chicago.* Passengers surged around us, a river of hats and hope. Vito’s gaze flickered to the platform.  

“You could come,” he said, too casual.  

“And do what? Knit socks while you play house?”  

He stepped closer. Sandalwood and sweat. “You’d suck at knitting.”  

The kiss was a live wire—desperate and sweet and over too soon. His thumb brushed the silver streak in my hair. “I’ll be back,” he murmured against my lips.  

“Liar.”  

He pressed the coin into my palm. “Hold onto this. I’ll want it when I return.”  

I watched him board the train, his silhouette sharp against the grimy window. He didn’t wave. Neither did I.  

———  

That night, I wrote the last line of Arthur’s story. The Remington’s keys clacked like a heartbeat: *Sometimes justice is a quiet thing. A cleared name. A train whistle in the dark. A city learning to forget.*  

I left the Pulitzer medal on Fletcher’s desk with a bottle of rye. Let the next hungry reporter carve their name into the wood.  

———  

The apartment held ghosts. The dent in the floor where Vito’s fist had landed during an argument. The whiskey stain on the rug from the night we didn’t bother with glasses. I opened the window, let the El’s rattle shake the dust from my bones.  

Under my pillow, the silver dollar winked in the moonlight.  

*Come back.*  

Somewhere beyond the city’s glow, a train whistle answered.
