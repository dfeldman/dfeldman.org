# Chapter 5: The Gilded Whisper  

The Beaumont Estate’s ballroom dripped with enough gold leaf to bankrupt a small nation. Vivian Sinclair adjusted the emerald comb holding her auburn wig in place, the false hair itching like a nest of spiders. Across the marble floor, Vito Romano stood statue-still in his tailored tuxedo, the scar on his knuckles catching candlelight as he accepted a glass of champagne. Their eyes met—a flicker of danger, a promise of later reckoning—before he turned to charm a dowager dripping in diamonds.  

“You’ll want this, *Lady DuPont*,” a voice purred. Lydia Fitzgerald materialized like smoke, her pearl bracelet brushing Viv’s bare shoulder as she pressed a cyanide-laced champagne flute into her hand. “The real fun’s in the library. Third bookshelf left of the Degas.”  

Viv forced a society-page smile. “I’d ask what you want in return, but we both know you’ll tell me when it amuses you.”  

Lydia’s rouge-darkened lips curved. “Kensington’s private gallery is *darling* this time of year. All those naughty forgeries…” She vanished into a swirl of jazz and cigarette haze, leaving Viv to navigate a sea of tuxedos and tiaras.  

The orchestra struck up *Let’s Misbehave* as Vito claimed Viv for the next dance. His hand settled low on her back, fingers splaying possessively over the silk. “You’re shaking,” he murmured, breath warm against her earlobe.  

“Lead poisoning,” she lied, feeling the Luger holstered beneath his tux jacket. “Metaphorical variety.”  

He spun her past a potted palm, their steps syncing with lethal precision. “That little weasel in the monocle’s been eyeing you all night. Friend of yours?”  

Freddie Winslow lounged against the bar, sniffing cocaine off a diamond-encrusted spoon. His gaze tracked Viv like a bloodhound. “Let’s find out.” She broke from Vito’s grip, striding toward Freddie with her stolen title trailing behind her like armor.  

“DuPont, darling!” Freddie’s laugh reeked of gin and bad decisions. He flicked his monocle’s chain. “Heard you’re in the market for… *unconventional* art.”  

Viv sipped Lydia’s poisoned champagne—a slow swallow, the flute’s rim hiding her tongue’s cautious dab. Sweet almonds. Bitter undertones. *Cyanide*. She set the glass down untouched. “I prefer pieces with *history*.”  

Freddie leaned close, his pupils dilated to inkblots. “Harry’s got a gallery buried deeper than his sins. Picasso’s weeping virgin, a Van Gogh even the French don’t know about…”  

Across the room, Charles Beaumont raised his glass in a toast. “To progress!”  

The word dissolved into a wet gurgle.  

Time fractured.  

Charles clawed at his cravat, cherry-red froth bubbling past his lips. His crystal flute shattered on the parquet as he collapsed, limbs convulsing. Viv lunged forward, the crowd’s screams muffled as she pressed fingers to his carotid. *No pulse*.  

“Move!” Kensington barked, shoving guests aside. His linen suit brushed Charles’ corpse, the Mayor’s hands steady as he retrieved a monogrammed flask from the dead man’s pocket. “Heart attack. Tragic, really.”  

Viv’s nails bit crescents into her palms. “That’s not what Doc Harlow will say when he smells the cyanide.”  

The Mayor’s smile could’ve frostbitten hell. “Doctors can be… *persuaded*.” He snapped his fingers, and two thugs hauled Charles’ body toward the service exit.  

Viv slipped through the chaos, snatching the flask Kensington had missed—*C.B.* engraved in art deco script. The stench of almonds clung to its silver mouth.  

**CONTINUE**  

The library’s secret door groaned open at Viv’s touch, revealing a vaulted chamber lit by a single Tiffany lamp. Ledgers lined the shelves, their spines stamped with dates and codenames. Somewhere behind her, the party’s dissonant laughter twisted into a funeral march.  

Footsteps echoed.  

Viv ducked behind a mahogany desk as Vito entered, his tux jacket slung over one shoulder. “Christ, Red. You’ve got nine lives and you’re burning through them like Pall Malls.”  

“I’m touched.” She emerged, clutching a ledger marked *Red Hook Dock 9 – 1928*. “Don’t let me stop you from fleeing.”  

He leaned against the doorframe, shadows sculpting the hard planes of his face. “You owe me a dance.”  

“I owe you a bullet between the eyes if you’re working for Kensington.”  

The ledger’s pages crackled as she flipped to June entries. *July 12: Vatican Holdings – 2 crates. July 19: Golden Throne (eyes missing) – 1 crate.* Her father’s pocket watch ticked louder.  

Vito gripped her wrist, his thumb pressing into the fluttering pulse. “I move crates. I don’t ask why.”  

“But you look.” Her free hand brushed the Luger under his shirt. “That’s your sin, Baron. Curiosity.”  

A floorboard creaked overhead. They froze, breaths mingling in the dusty air.  

“Third shelf!” a man barked. “The Degas moved!”  

Vito swore in Sicilian, yanking Viv into a hidden alcove. His body pinned hers against cold stone, the ledger crushed between them.  

Kensington’s thugs stormed in, flashlights sweeping the darkness. Viv counted heartbeats—hers erratic, Vito’s steady as a sniper’s.  

“Find them,” the larger thug growled. “Boss wants the girl’s tongue in a jewelry box.”  

The flashlight beam grazed Viv’s shoe. Vito’s hand slid to her hip, warm and warning.  

Somewhere in the mansion, a clock struck midnight.  

**CONTINUE**  

Viv woke alone in her apartment, dawn light stabbing through grimy windows. The ledger lay splayed across her father’s old desk, Red Hook entries circled in blood-red ink. Her mouth tasted of gin and Vito’s last whispered lie: *“This changes nothing.”*  

A knock rattled the door.  

Inspector Burns stood in the hall, his badge tarnished, his eyes red-rimmed. “Kensington’s declaring Charles’ death a suicide. The case is closed.”  

She brandished Charles’ flask, the *C.B.* glinting. “Tell that to the cyanide in his system.”  

“You think I don’t know?” Burns’ fist slammed the doorframe. “My granddaughter’s in a hospital bed because I asked too many questions!”  

The flask trembble in Viv’s grip. “So you’ll let him kill again?”  

“He already has.” Burns pressed a funeral notice into her hand—*Edward Malone, beloved nephew*. “Stay out of the tunnels, Sinclair. Not everyone comes back.”  

The door clicked shut.  

Viv turned the flask over, its silver marred by a single fingerprint—Lydia’s coral polish smudged on the cap. Outside, newsboys hawked the Mayor’s latest lie. Somewhere beneath the city, the Golden Throne waited, its empty eyes weeping poison.
