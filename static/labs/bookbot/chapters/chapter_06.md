**# Chapter 6: Gilded Deception**  

The tires of the stolen Packard spit gravel as we skidded up the Whitefields drive. Vito killed the headlights, plunging us into the amber glow of mansion windows. Somewhere beyond the rose hedges, a jazz trumpet sliced through the humidity. “You look ridiculous,” he said, adjusting his bowtie in the rearview mirror.  

I tightened the rhinestone garter around my thigh, the Derringer’s weight a cold kiss. “Says the man who smells like a bordello pillow.” The sandalwood cologne he’d splashed on at a gas station made my teeth ache.  

He smirked, fingers brushing the dagger-shaped tie pin. “Just play rich, doll. And try not to stab anyone before dessert.”  

The grand foyer was a cataract of champagne and chiffon. A butler dripped sweat onto our forged invitation. “Mr. and Mrs. Giovanni Moretti,” he announced. Vito’s grip on my waist tightened.  

Charles Beaumont held court beneath a chandelier, his laughter too sharp, too frequent. The Golden Throne loomed behind him on a dais—a Byzantine monstrosity of twisted gold, its arms ashen with fingerprints. Lapis lazuli eyes in the carved lions watched me. *Uncle Arthur dusted you every Tuesday.*  

“Champagne?” A waiter thrust a coupe into my hand. The bubbles stank of pear syrup and lies.  

Vito’s lips grazed my ear. “East terrace in ten. Romano’s going to case the—”  

“Vivian!” Lydia Fitzgerald materialized in a cloud of gardenias, her ice-blonde marcelle waves flawless. “Darling, you simply must try the caviar.” She hooked her arm through mine, nails digging crescents into flesh. “It’s *divine*.”  

The powder room door clicked shut. Lydia spun me, her cameo brooch catching the sconce light. “They’re moving it tonight. The Throne.” She pressed a cocktail napkin into my palm. Smudged lipstick bled through the linen: *STOP THE TRAIN.* “Midnight. Track nine.”  

“Why tell me?”  

Her laugh was a shard of crystal. “Because Kensington fucked my sister. Because Beaumont’s a pig who licks his fingers at supper.” She paused, a tremor fracturing her poise. “Because I’m tired of being wallpaper.”  

The door burst open. Vito leaned against the jamb, a cigarette dangling. “Mrs. Moretti. They’re serving soufflé.”  

We found Beaumont in the rose garden, his tuxedo jacket slung over Mayor Kensington’s shoulders. “—can’t delay the shipment!” The mayor’s cufflinks—onyx with diamond studs—glinted as he jabbed Beaumont’s chest. “That throne buys ten blocks of votes!”  

Beaumont swatted him off. “And my neck if the forgery’s spotted. Celeste cracked under pressure. The lapis is all wrong.”  

Vito stiffened. His hand crept toward his waistband. I caught his wrist. “Not here.”  

The orchestra struck up “Ain’t Misbehavin’.” He pulled me onto the parquet, his thigh sliding between mine as we joined the swaying mass. “You’re shaking, detective.”  

“Adrenaline.” Lie. His palm burned through the satin at my lower back. “We need to find the train schedules.”  

His fingers crept lower. “We need to not die.”  

I brought my heel down on his instep. He chuckled into my hair. “Always a fight with you.”  

We escaped to the terrace. The Long Island Sound hissed against the rocks below. Vito lit two cigarettes, passing me one. Our fingers brushed. “Rosa graduates next spring,” he said abruptly. “Top of her class. Wants to design hats. Ridiculous, no?”  

I exhaled a plume of smoke. It hung between us like a specter. “You’ll miss the bullets and backstabbing.”  

“I’ll miss the view.” His gaze dropped to my mouth.  

The cigarette trembbled. I stabbed it out on the balustrade, crimson lipstick bleeding into the filter. “We have a train to catch.”  

A gunshot cracked inside. Then another. Screams swallowed the jazz.  

Vito shoved me against the stone wall as guests stampeded past. “Stay close.”  

But I was already running toward the library. Toward the body sprawled on the marble—Beaumont’s vacant eyes reflecting the Golden Throne’s stolen glory. The pearl-handled dagger in his back still quivered.  

Mayor Kensington’s voice boomed through the chaos. “A tragedy! A *theft*!” His cuff gleamed in the blood pooling around the corpse.  

I turned. Vito was gone.
