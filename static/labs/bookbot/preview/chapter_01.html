                <p><strong># Chapter 1: Dust &amp; Shadows</strong>  </p>
<p>The mirror in my Hell’s Kitchen walkup showed a woman forged from stubbornness and sleepless nights. I pinned the <em>Daily Clarion</em> press badge to my lapel, its brass edges dulled from three years of Fletcher’s disdain. Dad’s pocket watch slipped into my silk stocking garter—9:15 a.m. Right on schedule for the guard shift change.  </p>
<p>Gallery 17’s bronze doors swallowed the morning sun whole. A security guard with shoulders like a stevedore blocked my path. “Press hour ended at eight.”  </p>
<p>I flashed credentials still warm from the printshop. “Vivian Sinclair. Arts &amp; Culture.” The lie tasted of ink and desperation. His eyes lingered on the hem of my skirt climbing the marble stairs—exactly as I’d planned.  </p>
<p>Linseed oil and marble dust filled my lungs. June heat pressed against stained glass windows, fracturing sunlight across the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne had presided over a thousand school tours. My thumbnail found the initials carved into the base—<em>T.S.</em>—still rough after twenty years. The air shifted.  </p>
<p>Old Spice. Gun oil.  </p>
<p>“Admiring your handiwork, Miss Sinclair?”  </p>
<p>Guard Joe materialized by a Titian forgery, nightstick tapping Morse code impatience against his thigh. His holster creaked with the particular whine of a Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless—Dad’s service weapon before the department disowned him.  </p>
<p>“Merely appreciating the Met’s commitment to replica artistry.” I traced chisel marks around the initials. “Though papier-mâché seems ambitious for Byzantine thrones.”  </p>
<p>His laugh turned phlegmy. “Tell that to the insurance sharks circling upstairs.”  </p>
<p>The gallery door groaned. A willowy docent stumbled in, Prussian blue paint dripping from her smock to puddle around our feet.  </p>
<p>“<em>Pardonnez-moi!</em>” Her French accent trembled as she blotted the spill. “The restoration team—<em>c’est un désastre!</em>”  </p>
<p>Something glinted in the cobalt smear. Not glass. A key.  </p>
<p>I bent, silk stocking tearing as cold steel kissed my thigh.  </p>
<p>“Scream and I’ll gift the Met a new Pollock.” The blade pressed through my skirt, drawing first blood.  </p>
<p>Dad’s voice echoed from academy days long buried: <em>Never show fear.</em> My Oxford heel found his instep. Bone crunched.  </p>
<p>The knife clattered as I spun—  </p>
<p>Empty air.  </p>
<p>Tapestries rippled where someone had vanished behind scenes. Guard Joe’s whistle shrilled through the gallery.  </p>
<p>“You hit, Red?”  </p>
<p>The voice rolled through me like bourbon over gravel. A man leaned against the doorway, silver lighter dancing through scarred fingers. <em>Click. Click. Click.</em> Black hair gleamed with enough pomade to drown a flapper, shirt sleeves rolled past forearms mapped with knife fights and poor decisions.  </p>
<p>I pressed a gloved hand to my leg. “Do they let vultures in before the corpse cools?”  </p>
<p>He shrugged, all loose joints and calculated indifference. “Curiosity killed the cat, doll. Good thing you’ve got nine lives.” The lighter arced through sunlight. I caught it cold—<em>Rosa</em> etched in looping script.  </p>
<p>“Check your blind spots next time.” His grin showed a chipped canine. “This museum’s got more tunnels than the IRT.”  </p>
<p>The docent whimpered. Her shoe “accidentally” nudged the key beneath a display case, Prussian blue streaking the floor in the exact pattern from Dad’s case files. Guard Joe’s radio barked to life: “All units to Egyptian Wing—10-31 in progress!”  </p>
<p>I limped toward the exit, blood seeping into my T-strap. The stranger’s gaze burned between my shoulder blades.  </p>
<p>“Keep the lighter, Red. Matches your eyes.”  </p>
<hr />
<p>The Sixth Avenue El rattled past the <em>Clarion</em>’s soot-stained windows. I dabbed iodine on my thigh beneath the desk, the sting barely registering over Fletcher’s cigar fumes choking the city room.  </p>
<p>“Ghost hunting again, Sinclair?”  </p>
<p>He snatched the half-typed page from my Underwood: <em>Mayor’s “Philanthropy” Fund Finances Mob Operations.</em>  </p>
<p>“That’s three days’ work!”  </p>
<p>“And worth less than the ash.” His Zippo flared. “No one gives a damn about dead janitors or missing relics. Give me gangland shootings. Divorce scandals. <em>News.</em>”  </p>
<p>The elevator clattered open. Eleanor’s archive cart squeaked past, her fox fur stole brushing my arm. A train ticket fluttered into my lap—<em>Grand Central → Dock 9. Midnight.</em>  </p>
<p>“You’re not even printing the truth anymore,” I spat.  </p>
<p>“Truth?” Fletcher slammed down the morning edition: <em>FLAPPER FOUND DEAD IN HARLEM SPEAKEASY</em>. My byline had been scalped. “Your old man sold lies for a living too. At least his made money.”  </p>
<p>Reporters paused mid-clatter. Copy boys froze with their coffee urns.  </p>
<p>I stood too fast, torn stocking catching on the desk drawer. “My father—”  </p>
<p>“Died a thief.” His jowls quivered. “Keep digging, Viv. You’ll hit China before you hit justice.”  </p>
<p>The lavatory mirror showed a stranger’s face—pale under rouge, gray eyes fever-bright. I scrubbed blood from under my nails as the stall door creaked.  </p>
<p>Eleanor leaned on her cane, arthritis twisting her fingers. “Gallery 17’s security logs vanished. But the freight elevator maintenance schedule…” She slid a blueprint under the partition.  </p>
<p>“Why help me?”  </p>
<p>Her reflection smiled. “Because unlike Fletcher, I remember when newspapers stood for something.”  </p>
<p>The door slammed. Lydia Fitzgerald’s Chanel No. 5 arrived first, then the woman herself—emerald earrings swinging, lips stained the color of fresh bruises.  </p>
<p>“Darling Viv! Heard you’re poking around Byzantine relics.” Her gloved hand lingered on my shoulder. “Careful. Museums bury their secrets deep.”  </p>
<p>She dropped a matchbook into my palm. <em>The Blind Owl. 145½ Mulberry.</em>  </p>
<p>“Ask for the canary.”  </p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>The El’s shadow swallowed Mulberry Street whole. A neon owl blinked above a boarded-up storefront, its hoot drowned by thunder rolling in from Jersey. Three quick raps.  </p>
<p>“Password?”  </p>
<p>“The canary sings at midnight.”  </p>
<p>Bolts clattered. The speakeasy exhaled gin and desperation, sweat-slick bodies moving to a Bessie Smith record skipping on the phonograph. Sammy leaned across the mahogany, gold tooth glinting.  </p>
<p>“Sinclair.” He poured rye into a chipped teacup. “Vito said you’d come crawling.”  </p>
<p>The storeroom door creaked. Lamplight carved the man from shadows—shirtless, suturing a knife wound with hands steady as a surgeon’s.  </p>
<p>“Christ, Red. You track blood like a wounded doe.”  </p>
<p>Vito’s thumb brushed my torn stocking. His touch sparked something older than fear, hotter than shame.  </p>
<p>“Still patching up fools who pick fights,” I countered, tossing Rosa’s lighter.  </p>
<p>The name caught him mid-stitch. For a heartbeat, grief stripped him bare—then the mask slid back.  </p>
<p>“Sit.” He nodded at a whisky crate. “Unless you want to faint in front of Sammy’s customers.”  </p>
<p>The needle bit. His knuckles grazed my inner thigh—once, twice. Not accidental.  </p>
<p>“Why’s a society doll playing Dick Tracy?”  </p>
<p>“Same reason a bootlegger reads Nietzsche.”  </p>
<p>His laugh vibrated through the thread’s pull. The door crashed open.  </p>
<p>“Harding’s dead!”  </p>
<p>The crowd surged toward the entrance where a man lay sprawled, Prussian blue smeared across his collar. A train ticket protruded from his breast pocket—<em>Midnight. Pier 17. Cargo Hold 9.</em>  </p>
<p>Vito pressed it into my palm, blood seeping through the paper. “Still think this is a game?”  </p>
<p>We kissed in the alley’s stench of rotting fruit and revelation, his hands fisted in my hair like a man clinging to a cliff’s edge. Somewhere beyond the docks, fog swallowed the truth whole.  </p>

<hr />
<p>The Kensington Estate’s ballroom glittered with stolen art and borrowed time. I adjusted my emerald headband, forged documents tucked against my garter.  </p>
<p>“Eyes left, doll.” Vito’s tuxedo smelled of gun oil and orchids.  </p>
<p>Mayor Kensington waltzed past with Lydia on his arm, her limp masked by layers of silk.  </p>
<p>“Darling Viv!” She air-kissed my cheeks. “Still chasing phantom thrones?”  </p>
<p>Vito’s hand tightened on my waist. “Still auctioning city secrets?”  </p>
<p>The orchestra crescendoed. A waiter dropped a note into my champagne flute: <em>Library. Now.</em>  </p>
<p>Between leather-bound lies, Eleanor waited with blueprints.  </p>
<p>“Tunnels connect the docks to City Hall,” she whispered.  </p>
<p>Shouts erupted. Gunfire replaced violins.  </p>
<p>Vito smashed a window with a candelabra. “Time to fly, Nancy.”  </p>
<p>We repelled down ivy, my dress tearing on thorns. Charles Beaumont staggered from the hedge maze, clutching his gut.  </p>
<p>“Kensington...throne...” Blood bubbled on his lips.  </p>
<p>The pocket watch in his waistcoat read 11:07. Same as Dad’s.  </p>
<p>Bullets chewed marble as Vito dragged me behind a fountain. His mouth found mine—desperate, bruising—before shoving me toward the kitchen.  </p>
<p>A cleaver embedded where my head had been. I sprinted past screaming cooks, the throne’s absence louder than gunfire.  </p>
<hr />
<p>CONTINUE<br />

<hr />
<p>Pier 17’s shadows swallowed us whole. The Golden Throne gleamed under a tarp, emeralds winking like dead men’s eyes.  </p>
<p>“Decoy,” I breathed.  </p>
<p>Celeste emerged from the dark, scalpel glinting. “Clever girl.”  </p>
<p>Her blade slashed. I fired.  </p>
<p>The throne toppled, revealing the real relic beneath—crusted with blood, Dad’s watch chain tangled in its jewels.  </p>
<p>Sirens wailed. Vito pressed his lighter into my palm.  </p>
<p>We kissed as the world burned, his hands in my hair, the Hudson singing our requiem.  </p>
<hr />
<p>The <em>Clarion</em>’s headline screamed next morning: <em>MAYOR’S SECRET HOARD EXPOSED!</em> My byline bled beneath the fold.  </p>
<p>Fletcher dropped a severance check. “Get out.”  </p>
<p>Eleanor’s note arrived with my coffee—<em>St. Mary’s Orphanage. Ask for Rosa.</em>  </p>
<hr />
<p>The girl looked up from Celeste’s sketchbook, charcoal smudging her fingers.  </p>
<p>“Are you the lady who kills monsters?”  </p>
<p>Vito’s motorcycle roared outside. The future tasted like gasoline and absolution as I knelt.  </p>
<p>“The monsters are gone.”  </p>
<p>Her paper crane unfolded in my palm: <em>He’s watching.</em>  </p>
<hr />
<p>We raced the storm west, the throne’s ashes clinging to our shoes. Somewhere ahead, another city waited to bleed.</p>
