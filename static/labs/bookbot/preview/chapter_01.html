                <h1>Chapter 1: Dust &amp; Shadows</h1>
<p>I arrived at the Metropolitan Museum on the morning of June 3, 1929, at exactly 10:00 AM. Gallery 17 greeted me with fractured sunlight bleeding through stained glass, dappling the floor in emerald and crimson. The air hung thick with linseed oil and the damp musk of stone—a scent that clung to my throat. At the center of the room, the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne once stood gaped like a missing tooth, its papier‑mâché replacement crude and mocking.  </p>
<p>My press badge swung against my chest as I approached. I traced the pedestal’s carved base, my finger catching on familiar grooves: my father’s initials. A faint aroma lingered—bay rum, sandalwood, gun oil—the ghost of him. My satchel brushed my hip, heavy with his pocket watch. The theft wasn’t just a story; it was a key.  </p>
<p>Guard Joe loomed nearby, hand resting on his holster. Celeste, the docent, adjusted a nearby placard, her smock streaked with vermilion and umber. She moved like a woman accustomed to blending into walls.  </p>
<p>Then I saw it: a shadow shifting behind the Byzantine tapestries. Steel flashed. I stumbled back as the blade sliced through silk and skin. Blood dripped onto the mosaics, each drop a scarlet punctuation mark.  </p>
<p>“Curiosity kills, Red.”  </p>
<p>The voice came from the doorway. Vito stood silhouetted against the light, a silver lighter flicking open in his palm. His eyes locked on mine as the lighter fell. I caught it midair. <em>Rosa</em> danced across its surface in cursive.  </p>
<p>Before I could speak, Celeste knocked over a paint can—Prussian blue flooding the floor. The same shade as the tunnel maps in my notes. Not an accident. A breadcrumb.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The walk to the <em>Daily Sentinel</em> was a blur of grit and adrenaline. By 2:30 PM, I slumped at my desk, the newsroom’s cigar haze sticking to my skin. My stocking clung to the half-dried wound. I fed paper into the typewriter, keys clattering: <em>Initials. Blood. Lighter. Blue.</em>  </p>
<p>Fletcher materialized like a storm cloud. He snatched the draft, struck a match, and let flame devour the words. “Chase ghosts, you’ll join them.” Ash floated in the sink.  </p>
<p>I restarted, wrists rigid. The pain in my thigh throbbed in time with the overhead fans. Eleanor’s cart creaked past. Her fingers brushed mine—<em>Follow the blue. —Madame X</em>—before she melted into the labyrinth of filing cabinets.  </p>
<p>The train ticket appeared next, slipped between carbon copies. <em>Midnight. Don’t be late. —V.</em> The <em>V</em> coiled in my gut.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The Blind Owl speakeasy stank of gin and regret. Vito found me at a corner table, his hands steady as he cleaned the cut. I kept my gaze on the broken phonograph wailing Bessie Smith. His knuckles grazed my inner thigh when the needle skipped.  </p>
<p>A drunk lurched into us, fingers groping my collarbone. I shoved him hard, but he grabbed my wrist. Vito’s bottle met his temple. The crunch of bone. The man crumpled, leaving a crumpled manifest in his wake: <em>Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight.</em>  </p>
<p>“Why Pier 17?” I asked later, watching Vito wipe bourbon from his sleeves.  </p>
<p>He lit a cigarette. The ember flared. “That throne’s a skeleton key. Opens doors even your daddy couldn’t.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The pier loomed at midnight, its planks groaning under my heels. Salt and diesel choked the air. Two men murmured by the cargo crates—<em>shipment delayed</em>—<em>boss wants it buried</em>. I crouched behind a coil of rope, manifest crumpled in my fist.  </p>
<p>Back in my Thompson Street apartment, I spread the clues like tarot cards: lighter, ticket, note, bloodstained stocking. The pocket watch ticked. <em>Rosa.</em> My mother’s name, etched on a stranger’s trinket.  </p>
<p>Sleep didn’t come.  </p>

<p>———  </p>
<p>Dawn crept through cracked blinds as I rewrote the night’s events. Every detail mattered: the bay rum, the lighter’s engraving, the way Vito’s jaw tightened when I mentioned Pier 17. I tucked the notes into a hollowed-out copy of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>—Fitzgerald’s prose hiding my own.  </p>
<p>At the Sentinel, Fletcher ignored me. Eleanor left a fresh pot of ink on my desk. The phone rang twice—dead air both times.  </p>
<p>By noon, I stood outside the tailor shop hiding the Blind Owl’s entrance. Celeste emerged, her docent uniform replaced by a cloche hat and moth-eaten coat. She froze when she saw me.  </p>
<p>“The blue paint,” I said, stepping into her path. “You wanted me to follow it.”  </p>
<p>Her laugh was a dry rasp. “Honey, I just spill things. Ask your bartender.”  </p>
<p>She vanished into the crowd.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>That night, I returned to Pier 17. The crates were gone. Only a tide-smoothed scrap of paper remained: <em>R.I.P. ROSA</em> in smudged charcoal.  </p>
<p>The pocket watch weighed my satchel down as I walked home. Three blocks from my apartment, a black Packard rolled alongside me. The window slid down.  </p>
<p>“Keep digging, and you’ll bury yourself,” a man’s voice said.  </p>
<p>Tires screeched. Gravel stung my cheeks.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>In my bathroom, I peeled the bandage off. The stitches held. <em>Rosa.</em> The name echoed. Mother’s suicide when I was six. Father’s “accident” last spring. Coincidences were for fools.  </p>
<p>I poured bourbon, lit a cigarette, and stared at the manifest. Midnight had passed. The throne was still missing. But the trail wasn’t cold—it was burning.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p><strong>[Word count so far: 869]</strong>  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>Fletcher cornered me at the water cooler. “Drop the art heist. City desk needs obits.”  </p>
<p>“I’m close.”  </p>
<p>He snorted. “You’re a columnist, not Dick Tracy.”  </p>
<p>The train ticket crinkled in my pocket. That afternoon, I boarded the 4:15 to Yonkers. The manifest’s address led to a boarded-up warehouse. Inside, dust motes swam in shafts of light. A single crate sat center floor.  </p>
<p>No throne. Just a faded playbill: <em>ROSALIND’S FOLLY, 1912.</em> Mother’s stage name glared up at me.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>Vito found me at the Blind Owl’s bar. “Pier 17 was a decoy,” I said, sliding the playbill toward him.  </p>
<p>He studied it. “Rosa’s been dead years. Why dredge her up now?”  </p>
<p>“Same reason they’re using my father’s initials. This isn’t about art.”  </p>
<p>He ordered two whiskeys. “It’s about blood.”  </p>
<p>We drank in silence.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The museum’s night guard let me in after hours. Joe’s keys jangled as we slipped into Gallery 17. I knelt by the pedestal, flashlight beam catching something glinting in the mortar—a shard of lapis lazuli. Prussian blue.  </p>
<p>Joe whistled. “Tunnels under the museum. Rumor is they connect to the docks.”  </p>
<p><em>Follow the blue.</em>  </p>
<p>I palmed the stone. “Show me.”</p>
