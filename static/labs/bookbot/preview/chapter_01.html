                <h1>Chapter 1: Ghosts of Gilt</h1>
<p>The icebox shuddered to life as Vivian Sinclair pressed her forehead against its door. Condensation dripped down the rusted handle, mimicking the sweat sliding between her shoulder blades. June heat pooled in her fourth-floor walkup like spoiled syrup, thickening the air until even her typewriter keys stuck mid-sentence.  </p>
<p>She’d left the window open all night, but the Hudson Diner’s neon sign still blinked through the grime-streaked glass—<strong>EAT</strong> in jagged crimson letters that tattooed the opposite wall. It illuminated her bulletin board in hellish flashes: police reports pinned like butterfly specimens, a <em>New York Sentinel</em> clipping screaming <strong>MUSEUM HEIST UNSOLVED!</strong>, and the photograph that never moved.  </p>
<p><em>Joseph Sinclair, 1924</em>. Father’s smile frozen mid-laugh, one hand raised as if to block the camera. The scar on her collarbone itched where the burglar’s knife had kissed bone three years ago. Same blade that slit Dad’s throat.  </p>
<p>Viv slammed the icebox. The lone ice cube trembled in her coffee as she crossed to the Underwood. Three strikes on the spacebar—her morning ritual—before rolling in fresh paper.  </p>
<p>The headline wrote itself:  </p>
<p><strong>MAYOR’S “CLEAN STREETS” A BLOODY JOKE</strong>  </p>
<p>Her fingers flew, words clattering like the Sixth Avenue El outside. <em>Kensington’s initiative targets only immigrant neighborhoods… sanitation trucks spotted at Red Hook Dock 9 after midnight…</em>  </p>
<p>A cockroach skittered across the desk. Viv crushed it with her coffee cup, staining the Mayor’s speech notes caramel.  </p>
<hr />
<p>“Sinclair!”  </p>
<p>Fletcher Johnson’s glass eye caught the newsroom’s green-shaded lamps as he emerged from his fishbowl office. Teletype machines stuttered morse-code secrets behind him. “You covering Kensington’s presser or auditioning for <em>Les Misérables</em>?”  </p>
<p>Viv leaned back in her chair, suspenders digging into her shoulders. “Thought I’d spice up the fluff piece.” She tossed him her draft. “Turns out ‘grit’ involves more than hosing down tenements.”  </p>
<p>Fletcher scanned the page, his prosthetic iris glinting like a shark’s. “<em>Bloodstains persist under Kensington’s new asphalt</em>,” he read aloud. A copyboy froze mid-stride. “Cute. You get a quote from the corpses?”  </p>
<p>“Got a source at Bellevue.”  </p>
<p>“You got squat.” He crumpled the paper. “City desk needs 500 words on the Mayor’s haircut, not a conspiracy theory.”  </p>
<p>The bulletin board photo burned against her spine. She’d hung it facing her desk so Fletcher couldn’t see Dad’s smile.  </p>
<p>“The Golden Throne heist,” she said quietly. “Three guards dead, eight million in art gone. And you buried it on page twelve.”  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s real eye twitched. “You’re a society reporter, not Elliot Ness.”  </p>
<p>“Joseph Sinclair was—”  </p>
<p>“A damn good journalist.” He slammed his fist, toppling a glue pot. “Who chased ghosts until they strangled him with his own press pass. You want that?”  </p>
<p>Viv pocketed the crumpled draft. “I want the truth.”  </p>
<p>“Truth won’t pay your rent.” Fletcher jabbed a finger toward the elevator. “Kensington’s speech. No metaphors, no murder accusations. Just—”  </p>
<p>“<em>A fresh start for our fair city</em>,” Viv mimicked in the Mayor’s baritone. “Yeah, I’ve read his ghostwriter’s fanfiction.”  </p>
<p>The elevator grate clanged shut behind her.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Rex Donovan waited at her desk, smelling of rye and gun oil.  </p>
<p>“You’re late, Red.” He eased his weight off the bad leg—shrapnel from the Argonne, he’d told her once. Or a jealous husband’s bullet. With Rex, the story changed hourly.  </p>
<p>Viv flicked glue off her chair. “If you’re here to sell more ‘Mayor loves goat yoga’ scoops…”  </p>
<p>“Cute.” A matchbook slid across the desk. <em>The Sapphire Rabbit</em> glinted in Art Deco script. “Ask Sammy about Mr. X. Seems your throne’s got new friends.”  </p>
<p>Her pulse quickened. “What kind of friends?”  </p>
<p>“The cyanide-and-shotgun variety.” Rex adjusted his fedora, a dossier slipping from his coat. She glimpsed <strong>RED HOOK DOCK 9</strong> before he snatched it back. “Be sweet to Fletcher. He’s got a soft spot for doomed brunettes.”  </p>
<p>The elevator pinged. Viv palmed the matchbook as Fletcher bellowed, “SINCLAIR! MOVE YOUR—”  </p>
<p>She was already gone.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Rain slicked the tenement stairs. Viv relocked the door three times—Dad’s habit, now hers—before confronting the bulletin board.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s bloodstained notebook lay buried under insurance reports. She’d memorized every smear:  </p>
<p><em>Victim 1: Giovanni Rossi, security guard. Throat slashed matching the throne’s lion claws…</em>  </p>
<p><em>Victim 3: Eleanor Choi, curator. Drowned in Central Park Pond, lungs filled with gold leaf…</em>  </p>
<p>Her finger traced the final entry, ink blurred by… coffee? Tears?  </p>
<p><em>They’re coming for the eyes. The emeralds aren’t—</em>  </p>
<p>The page ended.  </p>
<p>Rain blurred the diner’s neon into hellfire. Viv struck a match, watching Kensington’s speech notes curl to ash.  </p>
<p><em>Let’s see you spin this, Your Honor.</em>  </p>
<hr />
<p>The Sapphire Rabbit’s bouncer had spiderwebs tattooed across his throat.  </p>
<p>“Sammy.” Viv flashed the matchbook. “I need a name.”  </p>
<p>Sammy Delgado polished a glass, eyes on the jazz trumpeter’s solo. “Mr. X likes cash. Fifty bucks, Pier 17 at midnight.”  </p>
<p>“Or?”  </p>
<p>He nodded toward the back booth. Two men in pinstripes split an oyster, their laughter sharp as shucked shells.  </p>
<p>“Or you end up fertilizer for Kensington’s roses.”  </p>
<p>Viv dropped a nickel in the jukebox. “Play <em>‘St. James Infirmary.’</em>”  </p>
<p>Sammy’s tattoo rippled as he laughed. “Your dad’s favorite.”  </p>
<p>The music swelled, bitter as bootleg gin. She wondered if drowning in gold leaf felt like champagne.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>The harbor wind gnawed through Viv’s peacoat as she approached Pier 17. Moonlight painted the dockworkers’ faces cadaverous—all scarred knuckles and suspicious glares. A freighter loomed in the fog, its hull stamped <strong>VATICAN HOLDINGS</strong>.  </p>
<p>“You Sinclair?”  </p>
<p>The man emerged from the shadows, cheeks pockmarked by old acne or shrapnel. Eddie Malone, according to Sammy. His pinky ring glinted—a lion crest she’d seen on Kensington’s campaign posters.  </p>
<p>“Fifty.” Eddie spit tobacco. “Upfront.”  </p>
<p>Viv fanned the bills. “Talk.”  </p>
<p>“Mayor’s got a storage locker. Dock 9.” He glanced at the freighter. “They move crates tonight. Art shit, maybe your sparkly chair.”  </p>
<p>“Who’s your contact?”  </p>
<p>“Some Eye-talian mobster. Vito something.” Eddie snatched the cash. “Word of advice, lady? Stop digging before you hit your daddy’s coffin.”  </p>
<p>The dock bell tolled. Viv turned—  </p>
<p>—and froze.  </p>
<p>Two men in black overcoats materialized behind her. Tommy guns slung like violins.  </p>
<p>Eddie paled. “Aw, hell.”  </p>
<p>The first bullet caught him between the eyes.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>Viv dove behind a pallet stack, splinters scoring her palms. Gunfire shredded the night. She fumbled for her switchblade, the pearl handle slippery with sweat.  </p>
<p>“Sinclair!” A hand yanked her backward.  </p>
<p>Rex shoved her into a rowboat, his Luger barking three shots. “You’re a walking obit!”  </p>
<p>The freighter’s horn drowned her retort. Oars scraped the hull as they fled into the fog. Eddie’s body bobbed in their wake, his lion-ringed hand reaching skyward.  </p>
<p>Viv unclenched her fist. A rosary beads cut her palm—snatched from Eddie’s pocket as he fell.  </p>
<p>“Red Hook Dock 9,” she whispered.  </p>
<p>Rex rowed faster. “Forget it.”  </p>
<p>“They killed him to shut me up.”  </p>
<p>“They’ll do worse to you.” He nodded at the rosary. “Keep that. Might save your soul.”  </p>
<p>The river swallowed the gunfire. Somewhere, the Golden Throne’s emeralds glowed in the dark—waiting.</p>
