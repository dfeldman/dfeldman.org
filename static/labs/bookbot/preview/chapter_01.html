                <p><strong># Chapter 1: Dust &amp; Shadows</strong>  </p>
<p>The stink of linseed oil hit me like a sucker punch when I stepped into Gallery 17. June sunlight fractured through stained glass windows, painting the empty pedestal where the Golden Throne once sat in jagged shards of color. My fingers found the initials carved into the marble base—<em>T.S.</em>—and for a heartbeat, I smelled Old Spice and gun oil instead of museum dust.  </p>
<p>“Press badge don’t give you permission to fondle exhibits, Miss Sinclair.”  </p>
<p>Guard Joe’s voice snapped me back. His holster creaked as he shifted weight, nightstick tapping a Morse code of impatience against his thigh. I held up my hands in mock surrender, the chain of Dad’s pocket watch digging into my palm where I’d clenched it in my satchel.  </p>
<p>“Just admiring the craftsmanship,” I lied, tracing the chisel marks around the initials. “That papier-mâché replica’s almost convincing. From five feet away.”  </p>
<p>His laugh turned into a wet cough. “Tell that to the Met’s insurance adjusters.”  </p>
<p>The gallery door groaned. A docent with paint-stained fingers hurried in, her blonde chignon unraveling. Prussian blue smeared across her smock matched the shade dripping from the “Byzantine artifacts” sign she carried.  </p>
<p>“Terribly sorry!” Her French accent wobbled as she mopped the spill with a rag. “The restoration team—<em>mon dieu</em>, such a disaster upstairs!”  </p>
<p>Something glinted in the puddle. Not glass. A key.  </p>
<p>Cold steel kissed my thigh before I could bend.  </p>
<p>“Scream and I fillet that pretty neck,” a man’s voice hissed.  </p>
<p>The blade sliced through silk stocking, blood welling hot. I stomped backward, crunching his instep with my Oxford heel. He grunted. The knife clattered as I whipped around—  </p>
<p>Empty air.  </p>
<p>Only the Byzantine tapestries swayed, their gold threads catching light where someone had slipped behind.  </p>
<p>“You alright, Red?”  </p>
<p>The new voice rolled through me like bourbon smoke. A man leaned in the doorway, silver lighter flicking open and shut in his hand. <em>Click. Click. Click.</em> Black hair gleamed with too much pomade, his shirt sleeves rolled to reveal forearms corded with muscle and old scars.  </p>
<p>I pressed a hand to my bleeding leg. “Do I look alright?”  </p>
<p>He shrugged, all loose-limbed nonchalance. “Curiosity kills. But since you’re still breathing…” The lighter arced through the air. I caught it on reflex—engraved with a single name. <em>Rosa.</em>  </p>
<p>“Check your six next time.” His grin showed crooked teeth. “This museum’s got more snakes than the Bronx Zoo.”  </p>
<p>The docent whimpered. I turned just in time to see her “accidentally” kick the key under a display case. Prussian blue paint streaked the floor in the exact pattern of tunnel maps I’d seen in Dad’s old case files.  </p>
<p>Guard Joe’s radio crackled to life. “All units to Egyptian Wing—possible 10-31!”  </p>
<p>I limped toward the exit, blood trickling into my shoe. The stranger’s gaze burned between my shoulder blades.  </p>
<p>“Keep the lighter, Red,” he called. “Looks better on you anyway.”  </p>

<p>The newsroom ceiling fans churned cigar smoke into a toxic soup. I dabbed iodine on my thigh under the desk, hissing as it seared the knife cut. My typewriter held a half-finished expose: <em>Mayor’s “Cleanup” Campaign Leaves Bloodstains on Fifth Avenue.</em>  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s shadow fell across the page. “Ghost chasing again, Sinclair?”  </p>
<p>He yanked the paper free, match flaring. My words curled black at the edges.  </p>
<p>“That was three days’ work!”  </p>
<p>“And worth less than the ash.” His jowls quivered. “No one cares about dead janitors or missing gold chairs. Give me gangland shootings. Mistress scandals. <em>Real</em> news.”  </p>
<p>The elevator dinged. Eleanor’s archives cart squeaked past, her lace glove brushing my shoulder. A scrap of stationery fluttered into my lap—<em>Follow the blue. -Madame X</em>  </p>
<p>“You’re not even printing the obits anymore,” I spat at Fletcher.  </p>
<p>“Obits don’t sell papers. <em>This</em> does.” He slapped down the morning edition: <em>FLAPPER FOUND DEAD IN HARLEM JAZZ JOINT</em>. Beneath the headline, my byline had been stripped.  </p>
<p>The clatter of keys around us died. Reporters stared like vultures scenting weakness.  </p>
<p>I stood too fast, my torn stocking rasping. “My father—”  </p>
<p>“Died a thief.” Fletcher’s smile showed nicotine-stained teeth. “Keep digging his grave deeper, Viv. You’ll hit China before you hit truth.”  </p>
<p>The ladies’ room mirror showed a pale stranger. Auburn hair clung damp to my neck, gray eyes fever-bright. I scrubbed blood from my hands as the stall door banged open.  </p>
<p>Eleanor leaned against the sink, her cane trembling. “Gallery 17’s security logs disappeared. But I found this.”  </p>
<p>A train ticket slid under the partition. <em>Grand Central → Dock 9. Midnight.</em>  </p>
<p>“Who’s Madame X?” I whispered.  </p>
<p>Her reflection smiled. “Someone who knows what it’s like to drown in men’s lies.”  </p>
<p>The door creaked. We froze as Lydia Fitzgerald swept in, emerald earrings catching the light.  </p>
<p>“Darling Viv!” Her perfume—Jicky by Guerlain—clogged my throat. “Heard you’re sniffing around the Met. Careful, hmm? Museums eat curious girls for breakfast.”  </p>
<p>She dropped a matchbook into my palm. <em>The Blind Owl. 45 Mulberry.</em>  </p>
<p>“Ask for Sammy. Tell him…” Her gloved finger traced my collarbone. “The canary sent you.”  </p>
<p>CONTINUE<br />

Midnight found me limping past Luigi’s Tailor Shop, the ticket burning in my purse. A neon owl’s eyes blinked red through boarded windows. Three knocks. A slit opened.  </p>
<p>“Password?”  </p>
<p>“The canary—”  </p>
<p>The door swung wide. Smoke and gin washed over me. A jazz trumpet wailed from a cracked phonograph as I pushed through the crowd of silk dresses and newsboy caps. The Blind Owl’s air tasted like gasoline-spiked whiskey and dangerous promises.  </p>
<p>“Whiskey neat,” I told the bartender, sliding onto a stool sticky with last night’s mistakes.  </p>
<p>Sammy’s gold tooth glinted as he polished a highball glass. “Ain’t you Viv Sinclair? Vito said you’d come.” Ice clinked like bones in a shallow grave as he poured. “He’s patching bullet holes in back. Try not to scream—he’s shy.”  </p>
<p>The storeroom reeked of iodine and blood. Vito hunched shirtless over a cracked mirror, suturing a gash across his ribs. Muscle rippled under olive skin as he turned, the flickering bulb painting his scars silver.  </p>
<p>“Jesus, Red. You bleed everywhere or just museums?”  </p>
<p>He pressed a flask to my lips. Cheap rye burned away my retort. His fingers—knuckles split and stained with printer’s ink—skimmed my torn stocking.  </p>
<p>“Got a thing for knives?”  </p>
<p>“Got a thing for assholes who steal lighters.” I tossed Rosa’s at his chest.  </p>
<p>His smile died. For a heartbeat, I saw the boy beneath the gangster—the one who still carried a sister’s name engraved in silver. Then he motioned me onto a crate, needle glinting.  </p>
<p>“This needs stitches.”  </p>
<p>“You offering?”  </p>
<p>The thread tugged flesh. His knuckles brushed my inner thigh—once, twice. Not accidental. The pain bit sharp and sweet.  </p>
<p>“So.” His breath warmed my knee. “Why’s a society columnist sniffing around stolen thrones?”  </p>
<p>“Same reason a mobster bartender carries a switchblade in his sock.”  </p>
<p>His laugh rumbled low. The door banged open.  </p>
<p>“Drinks, Vito!” Sammy shouted. “And keep the redhead quiet—Burns’ boys are sniffing outside.”  </p>
<p>The bar’s roar swelled as we stepped out. A drunk in a pinstripe suit grabbed my waist, rotgut breath scalding my cheek.  </p>
<p>“Dance, doll?”  </p>
<p>Vito’s bottle smashed across his skull. Glass shards glittered in bourbon puddles as the man crumpled.  </p>
<p>“Anyone else?” He wiped his mouth with a bloody fist.  </p>
<p>Silence fell. Then—  </p>
<p>“Harding’s dead!”  </p>
<p>A woman’s scream split the air. The crowd surged toward the door where a man sprawled, blood pooling under his head. Prussian blue smudged his collar—same shade as the museum key.  </p>
<p>Vito hauled me into the alley as sirens wailed. His palm pressed against my lower back, calluses scraping silk. A train ticket fluttered from the dead man’s pocket.  </p>
<p><em>Midnight. Pier 17. Cargo Hold 9.</em>  </p>
<p>He pressed the bloodstained paper into my hand. “Still think chasing ghosts is fun, Red?”  </p>
<p>The answer tasted like his kiss—whiskey, violence, and the sweet rot of lies.  </p>

<p>The Hudson breathed diesel fumes as I limped toward Pier 17’s skeletal outline. Fog clung to rusted cranes like cobwebs on a corpse. Somewhere in the dark, waves slapped against hulls filled with secrets.  </p>
<p>A shadow detached from the trawler’s hull—Vito’s cigarette flaring red.  </p>
<p>“Took you long enough.”  </p>
<p>“Had to lose Burns’ tail.” I nodded at the switchblade in his hand. “Expecting company?”  </p>
<p>“Always.”  </p>
<p>We picked through crates marked MACHINERY. Inside one, Renaissance Madonnas stared blankly through straw packing. Their gilt frames reflected the moonlight like accusation. The Golden Throne wasn’t here.  </p>
<p>“Check the manifests.” Vito jerked his chin at the trawler’s cabin, his breath frosting in the June heat.  </p>
<p>A guard’s flashlight swept the deck. I ducked behind an oil drum, the chain of Dad’s watch biting into my clenched fist. The beam passed—then snapped back.  </p>
<p>“Press badge,” the guard sneered, yanking my arm. “Kensington said you’d come.”  </p>
<p>His knife glinted. I kneed his groin, fumbling for the pistol at his hip. The safety stuck.  </p>
<p>Vito’s blade found the guard’s throat. “Wrong move, <em>idiota</em>.”  </p>
<p>Blood pattered on my Oxfords like warm rain. The manifest in his pocket bore Celeste’s signature—and a smudge of Prussian blue.  </p>
<p>“Tunnels,” I breathed. “Under City Hall. Dad’s notes—”  </p>
<p>A shot rang out. Wood splintered by my ear.  </p>
<p>“Run!” Vito shoved me toward the water.  </p>
<p>We leapt onto a passing coal barge as more gunfire chased us into the fog. His laugh was wild against my neck, the Hudson’s current humming a funeral dirry.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE<br />

The safe house stank of mildew and betrayal. Vito kicked the door shut behind us, his arm sliding from my waist as he lit a kerosene lamp. The flame guttered, revealing peeling cabbage-rose wallpaper and a mattress stained with more stories than I wanted to know.  </p>
<p>"Home sweet hell," he muttered, shrugging out of his bloodied shirt.  </p>
<p>I pressed the gun to his chest before he could turn. The scar above his heart pulsed like a second mouth. "Why'd you help me?"  </p>
<p>His fingers closed over the barrel, warm and unflinching. "Recognize this?" He guided my hand left, where old scar tissue formed a star-shaped crater. "Your old man took a bullet meant for me."  </p>
<p>The mattress springs screamed as I stumbled back. Dad's service revolver—missing since the heist—weighed sudden and terrible in my memory.  </p>
<p>Vito peeled the bandage from my thigh. "Been repaying that debt ever since."  </p>
<p>The needle bit flesh. Outside, rain began its interrogation on the tin roof. His thumb brushed my trembling lip when I gasped.  </p>
<p>"Stay still, Red. Unless you want this jagged."  </p>
<p>We didn't speak of the way his hands lingered, or how the storm drowned our breathing when the lamp died.  </p>

<p>Dawn found us in the Met's tunnels, Celeste’s key turning in a rusted lock. Dank air clung to our clothes as we crouched beneath Gallery 17. The Golden Throne gleamed in our lamplight—emeralds glittering like a drunk’s false promises.  </p>
<p>"Fake," Vito hissed, knocking a gem loose. It rolled into shadows, revealing corroded tin beneath gilding.  </p>
<p>But the real treasure lay underneath: Dad’s journal, wrapped in oilskin and guilt.  </p>
<p><em>Kensington ordered the hit,</em> the last entry read. <em>Protect the throne at all—</em>  </p>
<p>A shot echoed. Vito tackled me as the journal exploded in paper shrapnel.  </p>
<p>"Miss me, darling?" Lydia Fitzgerald stepped from the shadows, pearl-handled derringer smoking. Her emerald dress matched the throne’s false jewels. "Really, Viv—snooping in subbasements? You’ll ruin your complexion."  </p>
<p>Vito’s knife found her thigh before she could fire again. Her scream brought down centuries of dust as we fled through steam vents, Dad’s burned words clinging to our skin like funeral ash.  </p>

<hr />
<p>The Blind Owl’s back booth reeked of yesterday’s gin and tomorrow’s regrets. I traced the journal’s fragmentary warning: <em>...throne moves tonight...pier...</em>  </p>
<p>Sammy slid over a rickey, lime wedge bleeding into cheap gin. "Heard Kensington’s throwing a gala. All society swells and stolen art."  </p>
<p>Vito’s hand settled on my lower back, thumb brushing bare skin where my dress ripped. "Feel like dancing, Red?"  </p>
<p>His lips tasted of vengeance and vermouth. Somewhere beyond the boarded windows, a throne waited to bleed.  </p>

The Kensington estate’s ballroom shimmered with deception. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto women in fringed dresses doing the Charleston, their laughter sharp as broken champagne flutes. I adjusted my emerald headband, forgery documents tucked into my garter like a lover’s secret.  </p>
<p>“Eyes left,” Vito murmured, his tuxedo smelling of gun oil and orchids.  </p>
<p>Mayor Kensington waltzed past with Lydia on his arm, her limp barely noticeable beneath layers of silk. Her laugh sliced through the orchestra’s swell.  </p>
<p>“Darling Viv!” She air-kissed my cheeks, gardenia perfume cloying. “Still playing Nancy Drew?”  </p>
<p>Vito’s hand tightened on my waist. “Still selling out your friends?”  </p>
<p>The music crescendoed. A waiter in too-polished shoes dropped a note into my champagne flute: <em>Library. Now. -X</em>  </p>
<p>Between leather-bound lies, Eleanor waited with a blueprint. Her gloves trembled as she unrolled vellum.  </p>
<p>“Tunnels connect to the docks,” she whispered. “They’re moving it tonight.”  </p>
<p>Shouts erupted downstairs. Gunfire replaced violin strings.  </p>
<p>Vito smashed the window with a candelabra. “Time to go, Nancy Drew.”  </p>
<p>We repelled down ivy, his arms a vise around me. My dress ripped on thorns, blood blooming like poppies on silk. Across the lawn, Charles Beaumont staggered from the hedge maze, clutching his stomach.  </p>
<p>“Kensington wants—” His words drowned in a gurgle as another shot cracked.  </p>
<p>I lunged for his collapsing body. The pocket watch slipped from his waistcoat—engraved <em>H.K.</em>, hands frozen at 11:07.  </p>
<p>“Viv!”  </p>
<p>Vito yanked me behind a marble fountain as bullets chewed stone. His mouth found mine—desperate, bruising—before shoving me toward the kitchen.  </p>
<p>A cleaver embedded in the wall where my head had been. I kicked off heels, sprinting past screaming cooks. The throne’s absence screamed louder.  </p>

<p>Pier 17 swallowed us whole. Moonlight razored through crane shadows as we crept toward Cargo Hold 9. The Golden Throne sat exposed under a tarp, emeralds glinting like dead men’s eyes.  </p>
<p>“It’s a decoy,” I realized too late.  </p>
<p>Celeste stepped from the darkness, scalpel glinting. Moonlight caught the arsenic green of her smock. “Clever girl.”  </p>
<p>Her blade slashed toward Vito. I fired.  </p>
<p>The throne toppled. Underneath—the real one, crusted with blood and Father’s pocket watch chain tangled in its jewels.  </p>
<p>Sirens howled. Celeste fled into the fog, her scream trailing behind like a bad omen.  </p>
<p>Vito pressed Dad’s lighter into my palm. “For luck.”  </p>
<p>We kissed as the world burned.  </p>

<p>The front page screamed the next morning: <em>MAYOR’S SECRET ART HOARD EXPOSED!</em> My byline bled ink below the fold.  </p>
<p>Fletcher dropped a severance check on my desk. “Pack your things.”  </p>
<p>Eleanor’s note arrived with my coffee—a train ticket to Poughkeepsie and three words: <em>She’s at St. Mary’s.</em>  </p>
<p>The orphanage walls echoed with lost laughter. The girl looked up from Celeste’s sketchbook, her mother’s eyes staring through me.  </p>
<p>“Are you the lady who killed the bad men?”  </p>
<p>Vito’s motorcycle roared outside. The future tasted like gasoline and stolen emeralds.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE<br />

We raced the storm west, the motorcycle’s growl eating up miles of cracked highway. Vito’s leather jacket smelled of gunpowder and spearmint, his body a furnace at my back. The first raindrops hit like sniper fire.  </p>
<p>“Regrets, Red?” His shout frayed in the wind.  </p>
<p>I didn’t answer. The Hudson’s ghosts still clung to my hair—Celeste’s arsenic green smock, Lydia’s gardenia stench, Fletcher’s burning pages. The storm howled its approval.  </p>
<p>A roadhouse appeared like a mirage. We tumbled into a booth, dripping on linoleum. The jukebox crooned <em>St. James Infirmary Blues</em> as Vito ordered pie neither of us touched.  </p>
<p>“He’ll have men at every border,” I said, tracing the bullet hole in his hat brim.  </p>
<p>He caught my finger. “Let him.”  </p>
<p>The bathroom mirror showed a woman I barely recognized—auburn hair wild as a brushfire, eyes hard as the emeralds sewn into my bra. When I emerged, Burns sat at our table, rainwater pooling around his cheap wingtips.  </p>
<p>“Kensington’s dead.” His gold badge couldn’t hide the tremor in his hands. “They’re pinning it on you.”  </p>
<p>Vito’s knife appeared under Burns’ chin. “Your doing?”  </p>
<p>“They’ll be here by dawn.” Burns slid a dossier across the table—crime scene photos of the Mayor’s study, the real Golden Throne gleaming behind his corpse. “Take it. Just...make it stop.”  </p>
<p>The door slammed behind him. I stared at the throne’s familiar jewels. “This isn’t over.”  </p>
<p>Vito pressed Dad’s lighter into my palm. “Your move, Nancy.”  </p>
<p>We left Burns’ confession in the diner’s fryer, flames licking at his sins. The storm screamed our names all the way to Nevada.  </p>

<p>El Paso’s telegram office stank of dust and desperation. The clerk didn’t blink at my disheveled state as I tore open the message: <em>Need you back. -E</em>  </p>
<p>Eleanor’s codebook translated the rest against a saloon mirror—<em>New throne. New lies. Same snakes.</em>  </p>
<p>Vito packed the Colt while I loaded the typewriter, our silence heavier than the gunmetal sky. At the train station, a newsboy hawked the latest headline: <em>MAYOR’S MISTRESS FLEES COUNTRY!</em>  </p>
<p>Lydia’s photo smiled up at me, gardenia wilted in her hair.  </p>
<p>“You think she’s really gone?” Vito asked, heaving our trunk of evidence.  </p>
<p>I touched the scar on my thigh. “Nothing’s ever really gone.”  </p>
<p>The whistle blew. Somewhere ahead, another throne waited in another city’s guts.  </p>

<p>The Met’s new exhibit hall reeked of fresh varnish and old lies. Gallery 17’s plaque mocked me: <em>Generously Donated by the Kensington Estate.</em>  </p>
<p>Celeste’s daughter pressed a folded crane into my hand, her fingers smudged with charcoal. Inside: <em>He’s watching.</em>  </p>
<p>Mayor Kensington’s portrait leered from the wall—same ice-chip eyes, different tie. Ironic, how dead men still wore better silk than the living.  </p>
<p>Vito’s lighter flared. “Burn it?”  </p>
<p>The fire alarm wailed as we kissed in the chaos, his hands mapping the city’s scars beneath my dress. We ran laughing into the storm, the throne’s ashes clinging to our shoes.  </p>

<p>The safe deposit box held Dad’s final secret—photographs of Kensington shaking hands with Capone. Shipping manifests. A list of names that could topple empires.  </p>
<p>Vito whistled. “This is bigger than thrones.”  </p>
<p>I fed a page to the fireplace. “Empires have better legs to stand on.”  </p>
<p>He caught my wrist. “What’re you doing?”  </p>
<p>Flames danced in his eyes. “Starting a bigger fire.”  </p>

<p>Wyoming smelled of sage and second chances. The diner’s jukebox crooned Bessie Smith as I typed our story between coffee refills.  </p>
<p><em>Once upon a heist, a reporter and a thief...</em>  </p>
