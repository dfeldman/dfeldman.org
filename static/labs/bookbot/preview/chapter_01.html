                <h1>Chapter 1: Ghosts of Gilt</h1>
<p><strong>June 3, 1929 | 8:00 AM</strong>  </p>
<p>The icebox hummed like a dying man’s breath as I cracked two eggs into the skillet. Morning light cut through the grime on my apartment window, striping the bulletin board where my father’s face stared back from a yellowed photograph. Joseph Sinclair, 1926—two days before they found him in the Met’s loading dock with his throat slit and a museum guard’s baton shoved through his ribs.  </p>
<p>I ate standing up, grease dripping onto yesterday’s edition of <em>The Sentinel</em>. Mayor Kensington’s smirking face soaked up the yolk under the headline: <strong>“CLEAN STREETS, CLEANER CONSCIENCE!”</strong> The skillet hissed when I slammed it back on the stove.  </p>
<p>The ritual came next. Three taps on the Underwood’s spacebar to wake it up. A sip of bootleg gin from the teapot. Then the lie I told myself every morning since the funeral: <em>Today’s the day you’ll finish his story.</em>  </p>
<p>My fingers found the scar on my collarbone—a souvenir from chasing a pickpocket through the Bowery—as I reread Dad’s notes for the hundredth time.  </p>
<p><em>Golden Throne of Akbar: Mughal, 1572. Last seen in Met storage vault. Missing: twin emerald eyes (approx. 200 carats each). Security footage erased. Curator Heinrich Mueller resigned abruptly 3/14/26…</em>  </p>
<p>The words blurred. That smell came back—coppery and sweet, like pennies left in the sun. Blood soaking the notebook’s pages when I’d pulled it from his coat. His handwriting spasmed near the end: <em>Cursed? Six victims in three months—all linked to the heist. Heart attacks, drownings… even the damn janitor.</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Knock-knock-knock.</strong>  </p>
<p>I jammed the notebook into my desk drawer. Mrs. O’Hara’s shrill voice cut through the door: “Miss Sinclair! Either your icebox is electrocuting that cat again, or you’ve taken up the theremin!”  </p>
<p>“It’s a <em>new</em> theremin!” I shouted back, shrugging into my blazer. The pocket watch slipped from the lining—Dad’s, its hands frozen at 2:17 AM. I kissed the cracked glass before dropping it down my cleavage. Let the Mayor’s cronies try frisking me there.  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>10:15 AM | The New York Sentinel Newsroom</strong>  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s glass eye caught the light as I passed his office. “Sinclair! My desk. Now.”  </p>
<p>Teletype machines chattered like angry starlings. I stepped over a copyboy sleeping in a nest of AP wire reports and tossed my hat at the coat rack. Missed.  </p>
<p>“Fluff piece.” Fletcher slammed a folder on his desk, his good eye bloodshot. “Kensington’s speech at noon. ‘Clean Streets Initiative.’”  </p>
<p>I stared at the photo—Kensington posing with a broom beside a gleaming sanitation truck. “You want me to lick his boots while he launders blood money?”  </p>
<p>“I want you to write what pays the rent.” He leaned closer, whiskey and Sen-Sen smothering the air between us. “Chasing your father’s ghost won’t unkill him, Viv.”  </p>
<p>The pocket watch burned against my sternum. “At least ghosts don’t charge by the column inch.”  </p>
<p>Someone cleared their throat behind me.  </p>
<p>Rex Donovan leaned against my desk, his limp more pronounced today. The rye on his breath couldn’t mask the gun oil. “Heard you’ve been asking about Sammy Delgado’s establishment.”  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s chair creaked. “Get your mob gossip off my payroll, Donovan.”  </p>
<p>“Just sharing a lunch tip. Best corned beef in town.” Rex pressed a matchbook into my palm—<em>The Sapphire Rabbit, 83 Leroy</em>. Inside, scrawled in grease pencil: <em>Ask about Mr. X</em>.  </p>
<p><strong>CONTINUE</strong>  </p>
<p>The newsroom’s clatter faded as I palmed the matchbook. Rex’s dossier peeked from his coat—a shipping manifest with <em>Red Hook Dock 9</em> circled in red. He caught me looking and snapped the folder shut.  </p>
<p>“You still take your gin with lime?” he muttered.  </p>
<p>“You still carry that Derringer in your sock?”  </p>
<p>His laugh rasped like a match strike. “Only when I’m courting trouble.”  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s door flew open. “Sinclair! You’re late to suck up to City Hall!”  </p>
<p>I grabbed my notepad, Kensington’s speech notes crinkling in my fist. The furnace in the basement chose that moment to roar—or maybe it was my pulse.  </p>
<p>“Tell Sammy I want the ’24 batch,” Rex said too loudly. “None of that bathtub swill.”  </p>
<p>Outside, I lit a cigarette with a Sapphire Rabbit match. The flame trembled.  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>12:30 PM | City Hall Press Pool</strong>  </p>
<p>Mayor Kensington’s voice dripped honey over the crowd. “—and with these new sanitation protocols, we’ll scrub our fair city down to its virtuous bones!”  </p>
<p>I scribbled nothing. The matchbook’s edges dug into my palm.  </p>
<p>A sanitation worker passed out flyers. I grabbed his wrist. “Who’s Mr. X?”  </p>
<p>His pupils blew wide. “Lady, I just drive the truck.”  </p>
<p>The Mayor’s gaze snagged on me as I slipped away. His smile didn’t reach his eyes—flat and cold as the emeralds missing from the Golden Throne.  </p>
<p>In the alley, I burned Kensington’s speech notes with a Sapphire Rabbit match. The smoke tasted like my father’s last tip.  </p>
