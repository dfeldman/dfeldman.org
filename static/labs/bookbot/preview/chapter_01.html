                <h1>Chapter 1: Dust &amp; Shadows</h1>
<p>The smell hit me first - that peculiar museum cocktail of linseed oil and ancient stone, undercut by the crisp bite of fresh blood.  </p>
<p>Sunlight streamed through the Byzantine gallery's stained glass, casting fractured rainbows across the Golden Throne's empty pedestal. I ran my fingers along the carved marble base until they found the familiar grooves. <em>W.S.</em> William Sinclair. My father's initials, etched during his night shifts guarding this gilded relic. The ghost of his Old Spice lingered here - sandalwood and gun oil, the scent that still clung to his uniform when they zipped him into a body bag.  </p>
<p>"Miss? Gallery closes in ten minutes."  </p>
<p>The guard's holster creaked as he shifted behind me. Joe, according to his brass nametag. Early thirties, wedding band digging into sausage fingers. I flashed my press badge, watching his eyes drop to the <em>Daily Sentinel</em> engraving.  </p>
<p>"Just paying respects," I said, thumbing the dented pocket watch in my satchel - Dad's last birthday gift before the '26 heist. The throne's replacement loomed over us, a papier-mâché mockery painted gold.  </p>
<p>Something moved in the shadowed alcove behind the Turkish tapestries.  </p>
<p>I turned too slow.  </p>
<p>Steel flashed. White-hot pain seared my thigh as the blade sliced through silk stockings. Blood pattered onto 6th-century mosaics, pooling between Constantine's stone eyes.  </p>
<p>"Christ!" Joe fumbled for his revolver.  </p>
<p>The attacker melted into the labyrinth of display cases, footsteps echoing off vaulted ceilings. I pressed my palm to the wound, crimson oozing through fingers. The metallic tang mixed with museum dust, and for one dizzying moment, I smelled Dad's blood on the throne room floor three years back.  </p>
<p>A silver lighter clattered at my feet.  </p>
<p>"Curiosity kills, Red."  </p>
<p>The voice rolled through the gallery like bourbon over gravel. He leaned against the arched doorway, one shoulder cocked against a marble column. Italian-cut suit hugging narrow hips, hair black as the void between stars. His eyes - Christ, those eyes - dark enough to drown in, sharp enough to flay skin.  </p>
<p>I scooped the lighter, fingers tracing the engraving. <em>Rosa.</em> "You dropping clues or matches, stranger?"  </p>
<p>"Vito Romano." He didn't move from his post, thumbs hooked in waistcoat pockets. "And that's a warning, not an invitation."  </p>
<p>Behind us, a docent stumbled into a display stand. Prussian blue paint splattered across the security desk, dripping onto floor plans of the museum's lower levels. The docent - Celeste, her nametag read - dabbed frantically at blue-stained fingers. "Terribly sorry! These new exhibits..."  </p>
<p>I froze. The same shade marked tunnel routes in Dad's old case files.  </p>
<p>Vito pushed off the column, straightening his tie. "Better get that leg stitched, Ace. Next time..." He mimed slitting his throat, calloused fingers glinting with signet rings.  </p>
<p>The gallery doors slammed behind him.  </p>
<p>Joe mopped his brow with a stained handkerchief. "You want me to call an ambulance, lady?"  </p>
<p>"Just a scratch." I limped past him, blood trickling into my T-strap heel. Dad's watch ticked louder in my bag, keeping time with my racing heart. The shadows between exhibits seemed darker now, hungry.  </p>
<p>At the service entrance, I paused. Three drops of Prussian blue stained the door handle, still wet.  </p>

The Daily Sentinel newsroom smelled like desperation and burnt coffee. I slumped at my desk, thigh throbbing beneath a makeshift bandage torn from my petticoat. Across the bullpen, Fletcher Johnson's office window glowed like the gates of hell, cigar smoke curling through the crack beneath his door.  </p>
<p>My draft fluttered in the overhead fan's breeze - <em>Metropolitan Museum Security Lapses Continue</em> - every word meticulously sourced from Dad's old notes. The brass key I'd stolen from his effects three years ago dug into my palm, its teeth still sharp enough to draw blood.  </p>
<p>"Sinclair! My office. Now."  </p>
<p>Fletcher's bark carried over the clatter of Underwoods. I straightened my skirt, wincing as dried blood pulled at the gash. The editor's lair felt tighter than usual, photographs of Pulitzer Prize winners leering from nicotine-stained walls.  </p>
<p>He didn't look up from my article. "You're chasing ghosts."  </p>
<p>"And you're printing puff pieces while Kensington's men pick the city clean."  </p>
<p>His lighter flared. For a suspended moment, my byline curled black at the edges. "This isn't journalism." The flaming pages kissed his ashtray. "It's a suicide note."  </p>
<p>Ash drifted onto my Mary Janes. "My father died for that story."  </p>
<p>"Your father died a drunk who couldn't tell a Titian from a traffic ticket." Fletcher's jowls quivered with the lie we both knew by heart. "Chase phantom thieves, Viv, and you'll end up in the Hudson wearing concrete galoshes."  </p>
<p>The newsroom's electric lights buzzed like angry hornets as I stormed back to my desk. A fresh carnation rested against my typewriter - white petals blushing pink at the edges. Eleanor's signature move.  </p>
<p>Beneath the flower, a scrap of stationery fluttered to the floor.  </p>
<p><em>Follow the blue. - Madame X</em>  </p>
<p>The archives cart squeaked past, Eleanor's limp more pronounced than usual. Our eyes met through the cloud of her chiffon scarf. She nodded toward the ladies' lounge.  </p>
<p>I waited three minutes before following.  </p>
<p>Blood streaked the porcelain sink as I changed stockings. The lounge door creaked open, Eleanor's reflection appearing behind me in the flyspecked mirror.  </p>
<p>"Pier 17," she whispered, pressing a cold compress to my thigh. Her fingers trembled - not from the polio, I realized, but fear. "Midnight."  </p>
<p>"Who's your source?"  </p>
<p>The compress slipped. A fresh bloom of crimson darkened the linen. "Someone who wants Kensington's head on a platter as much as you."  </p>
<p>We both froze at the clatter of heels outside. Eleanor vanished into a stall as Lydia Fitzgerald swept in, gardenias wilting in her marcelled hair.  </p>
<p>"Darling Viv!"  </p>
<p>I caught her wrist an inch from my cheek. Her pulse rabbited beneath kid leather gloves. "Still doing Kensington's dirty work, Lyds?"  </p>
<p>Her laugh tinkled like broken chandelier crystals. "I'd sooner bed a subway rat. Though speaking of vermin..." She dropped a matchbook into the sink, crimson lips curling around the name. <em>The Blind Owl.</em>  </p>
<p>The newsroom clock chimed six.  </p>
<p>At my desk, the typewriter carriage held a new addition nestled between the keys - a Pennsylvania Railroad ticket stub.  </p>
<p><em>Midnight. Don't be late. - V</em>  </p>
<p>The inked V bled into the paper like a fresh wound. Outside, thunder growled its approval. I touched the lighter in my pocket, Rosa's name biting into my palm.  </p>
<p>Rain sheeted the windows as I boarded the downtown trolley. Somewhere beyond the storm, a throne made of lies waited to topple.  </p>

Neon bled through the Blind Owl's boarded windows, painting the sawdust floor in stripes of feverish pink. The bartender's rag moved in lazy circles, smearing the ghosts of last night's brawls into the mahogany.  </p>
<p>"Whiskey neat." I slid onto a stool, the gash in my thigh pulsing in time with the broken phonograph's rendition of <em>Empty Bed Blues</em>. "And your least-damaged towel."  </p>
<p>Sammy's gold tooth flashed as he set down a bottle of rotgut and a rag that might've been white during the Harding administration. "New policy. Blood stays on the customer."  </p>
<p>The back booth curtains parted. Vito emerged, sleeves rolled to reveal ink-dark tattoos snaking up corded forearms. His gaze locked on my leg. "Christ, Red. You wear trouble like perfume."  </p>
<p>He didn't wait for an invitation. Calloused hands shoved my skirt up to mid-thigh, the sudden exposure raising gooseflesh. I reached for my derringer.  </p>
<p>"Easy, tiger." Vito's breath warmed my knee as he examined the wound. "Just returning the favor." He nodded to my satchel where his lighter bulged against Dad's files.  </p>
<p>The iodine stung worse than the blade. I bit down on a bar napkin, watching Vito's lashes flutter against high cheekbones as he stitched the gash with surprising delicacy. His thumb brushed the inside of my thigh when he reached for more thread.  </p>
<p>"Still got that death wish, I see." A drunk wobbled up behind me, reeking of pickled eggs and regret.  </p>
<p>Vito didn't look up from his needlework. "Walk away, Carlo."  </p>
<p>The man's sausage fingers dug into my shoulder. "Why don't we all—"  </p>
<p>Glass shattered. Vito moved like lightning, the whiskey bottle's jagged edge now pressed to Carlo's quivering jowls. Blood mingled with bourbon as the blade bit flesh.  </p>
<p>"Apologize to the lady."  </p>
<p>Carlo's whimper died as police whistles screamed outside. The phonograph needle skipped, trapped in a wail of <em>nobody knows you... nobody knows...</em>  </p>
<p>Vito hauled Carlo's limp form behind the bar as the raid erupted. Boots pounded the floor above Luigi's Tailor Shop. A prohibition agent's flashlight beam swept the room.  </p>
<p>"Don't. Move."  </p>
<p>I froze, Vito's hand suddenly warm on my bare knee. Our breath mingled - his mint and menace, mine gin and adrenaline. The flashlight passed over our booth, illuminating the manifest that fell from Carlo's pocket.  </p>
<p><em>Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight.</em>  </p>
<p>The stamp glowed Prussian blue in the beam's glare.  </p>
<p>When the agents left, Vito pressed the soaked manifest into my palm. His thumb traced the hollow of my wrist. "Still curious, Ace?"  </p>
<p>Outside, a train whistle howled. Somewhere beneath the city, a golden throne waited to crown a king of liars.  </p>

Rain lashed the boarded windows as Vito's thumb lingered on my wrist. The manifest's blue ink smeared under our combined heat, matching the dried paint on my hem. Somewhere beneath the city's skin, tunnels pulsed like infected veins.  </p>
<p>"You're staring, Red."  </p>
<p>I jerked my hand back, the movement sending fresh fire up my leg. "Wondering how many girls you've stitched up in dark corners."  </p>
<p>His smile cut sharper than the needle. "Only the ones who bite."  </p>
<p>The speakeasy's single bulb swung above us, casting his face in chiaroscuro. For a heartbeat, he looked like one of Caravaggio's fallen angels - all danger and damnation. Then the light shifted, revealing the chip in his front tooth, the scar bisecting his left brow. Human after all.  </p>
<p>Sammy mopped Carlo's blood from the floorboards. "He'll sing to the bulls by sunrise."  </p>
<p>"Let him." Vito's gaze never left mine. "Kensington's dogs already know your scent."  </p>
<p>The name hung between us, sour as month-old gin. I traced the manifest's stamped coordinates. "Why help me?"  </p>
<p>A match flared. In its sulfurous bloom, I saw Rosa's name etched on the lighter, the same curve to the O as in the museum's blue graffiti.  </p>
<p>"Let's call it...professional curiosity." His knee brushed mine beneath the table. "That throne's cursed more men than syphilis."  </p>
<p>Outside, a newsboy's cry sliced through the downpour. <em>"Mayor vows cleanup! Fifth arrest in graft case!"</em>  </p>
<p>Vito's laugh tasted bitter. "Cleaning his own mess, more like."  </p>
<p>The pain in my leg sharpened, memory superimposing Dad's bloodied ledger over the manifest. Both led to the same truth - Kensington built his empire on stolen beauty.  </p>
<p>Vito produced a hip flask, the liquid inside catching the light like liquid amber. "Medicinal."  </p>
<p>Our fingers tangled around the silver. Somewhere beneath the whiskey's burn, I imagined tasting his secrets - the sister lost, the deals made in shadows. The flask's engraving matched his lighter. <em>Rosa.</em>  </p>
<p>He stood abruptly, chair screeching against floorboards. "Pier 17's no society tea dance. Still want to waltz?"  </p>
<p>I rose, weight balanced on my good leg. Dad's watch ticked its approval in my bag. "Try and stop me."  </p>
<p>The alley air clung like a wet shroud. Vito's hand settled on the small of my back, guiding me past overflowing gutters. His touch burned through soaked silk, promising protection and peril in equal measure.  </p>
<p>Somewhere downstream, a ship's horn bellowed. The storm had washed the city clean, but the real filth flowed underground.  </p>

The stench of rotting fish and diesel fuel clung to Pier 17 like a curse. Waves slapped against barnacled pylons as we crouched behind a stack of crates marked <em>Machine Parts - Fragile</em>. Moonlight carved Vito's profile into something feral - all sharp angles and darker intentions.  </p>
<p>"Five guards." His breath fogged the cold air. "Two on the trawler, three smoking by the warehouse."  </p>
<p>I followed his gaze to the rusted freighter <em>Maria Rosa</em>. Its deckhands wore Kensington's signature move - cheap suits over shoulder holsters. "Your fan club?"  </p>
<p>Vito's chuckle warmed my ear. "Third cousin's crew. They'd skin me for the bounty."  </p>
<p>Rain slicked the planks as we crept toward the warehouse. My heel caught in a knotted rope, the stumble sending a crate lid clattering. Frozen shrimp spilled across the dock like mutant pearls.  </p>
<p>"Christ, Sinclair." Vito yanked me behind a winch as footsteps approached. "Ever heard of subtle?"  </p>
<p>The guard's switchblade glinted. "Ain't you that dame from the papers?"  </p>
<p>His recognition burned worse than the iodine. I drove my knee upward, meeting only air as Vito's coal shovel cracked the man's skull. Blood arced across a stack of manifests.  </p>
<p>"Subtle's for corpses," I panted, rifling the thug's pockets.  </p>
<p>The warehouse door exploded outward.  </p>
<p>We ran through a nightmare of hanging nets and swinging cargo hooks. A bullet whined past my ear, embedding in a tuna's glassy eye. Vito returned fire, the shots echoing like Judgment Day in the metal caverns.  </p>
<p>Prussian blue caught my eye - a sketchbook splayed near a workbench, its pages fluttering in the salt wind. Celeste's signature swirled in the corner below meticulous Golden Throne studies, each marked <em>H.K.</em> in that damning azure.  </p>
<p>"Down!"  </p>
<p>Vito's tackle drove the breath from my lungs as another bullet shredded the air where my head had been. We rolled behind a pallet of iced mackerel, his body pinning mine to the reeking planks.  </p>
<p>"Still think this is a game?" His hips pressed against me, heartbeat thundering through layers of wool and anger.  </p>
<p>I wrenched the sketchbook free. "I think you're enjoying this."  </p>
<p>His retort died as searchlights swept the dock. The <em>Maria Rosa's</em> engines roared to life. Crates marked with Kensington's mayoral seal tumbled from a net, splitting open to vomit Renaissance reliquaries onto the filthy concrete.  </p>
<p>We watched through the slats as guards loaded the last of the throne's components - gilded armrests wrapped in burlap. My fingers itched for a camera.  </p>
<p>"Proof enough for your Pulitzer?" Vito's hand found the small of my back as we retreated.  </p>
<p>"First chapter." The sketchbook's pages stuck to my bleeding palm, Celeste's forgeries singing their siren song of complicity.  </p>
<p>Somewhere in the harbor, a lighthouse beam sliced through the downpour. It illuminated the manifest's coordinates inked on my skin - coordinates that led straight to City Hall's gilded underbelly.  </p>
<p>Vito pressed a key into my hand, still warm from his pocket. "Basement archives. Don't get caught."  </p>
<p>His lips grazed my temple, a threat masquerading as tenderness. The night suddenly felt alive with teeth.  </p>

The key burned against my palm as I limped home through the predawn gloom. My apartment welcomed me with its familiar smells - mildew, gun oil, and the ghosts of a hundred takeout meals. I spread the evidence across the kitchen table: Celeste's sketches, Vito's key, the manifest bleeding blue.  </p>
<p>Dad's pocket watch kept vigil beside my typewriter. 4:17 AM. The hour he'd died according to the coroner's report.  </p>
<p>I lit a Lucky Strike, the flare illuminating photographs from the museum's '26 heist. There - in the grainy background of a crime scene photo - a blur of Prussian blue on the pedestal base. The same shade Celeste had "accidentally" spilled.  </p>
<p>The cigarette trembled in my fingers. She'd been there. She'd known.  </p>
<p>A floorboard creaked in the hall.  </p>
<p>I palmed my derringer, heart punching my ribs. The shadow under the door thickened.  </p>
<p>"Viv? You decent?"  </p>
<p>Eleanor's whisper carried through thin wood. I released the breath I'd been holding.  </p>
<p>She entered like a wraith, medical bag in hand. "Let me see the leg."  </p>
<p>I perched on the chipped enamel bathtub as she cleaned the wound. Her hands steadier now, the nurse's training from her sanitarium days resurfacing.  </p>
<p>"Kensington's throwing a gala Friday." She bound fresh gauze with military precision. "I've secured you an invitation."  </p>
<p>The cigarette almost fell from my lips. "Since when do you hobnob with society?"  </p>
<p>"Since Madame X became the most sought-after columnist in Manhattan." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Wear the emerald sheath. It matches your..."  </p>
<p>"Murderous intent?"  </p>
<p>"Audacity." She pressed an embossed card into my hand. "The throne's final piece arrives by train tomorrow. Dock 9."  </p>
<p>The radiator hissed. Somewhere below, Mrs. O'Leary's radio crooned about the mayor's new anti-corruption task force.  </p>
<p>Eleanor paused at the door. "He'll have eyes everywhere."  </p>
<p>I rotated Vito's key in the lamplight. "Then we blind him."  </p>
<p>Alone again, I faced the evidence wall - string connecting mugshots to museum blueprints. Dad's face smiled from a 1923 picnic photo, his arm around Mom weeks before the consumption took her.  </p>
<p>The first gray light of dawn crept through the fire escape. Somewhere beneath City Hall, a retinal scanner guarded the truth. On the docks, a golden throne waited to crown a thief. And in the shadows between, a man with ink-stained knuckles and a sister's name etched in silver watched.  </p>
<p>I loaded fresh paper into the Underwood.  </p>
<p><em>The Metropolitan Museum's missing Golden Throne has resurfaced in the unlikeliest of places...</em>  </p>
<p>The carriage bell dinged. Outside, newsboys took up their cry. Somewhere a typewriter clattered, the city's heartbeat quickening.</p>
