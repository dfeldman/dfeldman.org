                <h1>Chapter 1: Ghosts of Gilt</h1>
<p><strong>June 3, 1929 | 8:00 AM</strong>  </p>
<p>The icebox shuddered like a dying man as Vivian Sinclair pressed her palm against its sweating door. Morning light cut through the apartment’s grime in fractured gold beams, catching motes of dust and the ghost of her breath. She hated this hour—the city still yawned itself awake, but her father’s pocket watch weighed heavy in her dressing gown, ticking louder than the El train rattling past her fire escape.  </p>
<p>She poured yesterday’s coffee into a chipped teacup, the liquid sludge-black and cold. Her eyes drifted to the bulletin board dominating the west wall. Newspaper clippings yellowed at the edges: <strong>MET HEIST STILL UNSOLVED (1926)</strong>, <strong>CURSE CLAIMS FOURTH VICTIM</strong>. At the center, a photograph of Joseph Sinclair stared back, his grin frozen mid-laugh under a Panama hat. The same grin he’d worn the night he’d shoved her into a taxi, blood blooming across his shirtfront.  </p>
<p><em>“Run, Vivvie. Don’t look back.”</em>  </p>
<p>The typewriter called to her.  </p>
<p>She settled at the rickety table, fingers hovering over the Underwood’s keys. Three deep breaths—her ritual—before tapping out the name that haunted her dreams:  </p>
<p><em>Joseph Sinclair. Joseph Sinclair. Joseph Sinclair.</em>  </p>
<p>The words blurred. Her scar itched, the one curving over her collarbone like a parenthesis. She dug her nails into the puckered flesh until the memory sharpened:  </p>
<p><em>1926. Rain sluicing down the museum’s marble steps. Her father’s notebook, pages stuck together with his blood, fluttering open to a sketch of the Golden Throne. Its emerald eyes glared up at her, luminous even in smudged pencil. Scrawled beneath: </em>“Victims of the curse—T. Walsh (suicide), E. Choi (drowned), M. Vasquez (burned)...*  </p>
<p>“Christ, Viv. You gonna mourn that machine all day?”  </p>
<p>Rex Donovan’s voice shattered the memory. He leaned against her doorframe, smelling of rye and gun oil, his limp more pronounced than usual. The scar bisecting his left eyebrow twitched as he tossed a matchbook onto the table. <strong>The Sapphire Rabbit</strong> glinted in raised gold letters.  </p>
<p>“Sammy says you’ve been askin’ about dockworkers.” His gaze lingered on the bulletin board. “Try Eddie Malone. Tell him Mr. X sent you.”  </p>
<p>She flipped the matchbook. Scrawled inside in smudged charcoal: <em>Ask about the throne.</em>  </p>
<p>“Since when do you play messenger boy?”  </p>
<p>“Since fools started dyin’.” He nodded at her father’s photo. “You’re chasin’ the same ghosts he did.”  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>10:17 AM | The New York Sentinel Newsroom</strong>  </p>
<p>Teletype machines clattered a staccato heartbeat as Viv shouldered past copyboys. Fletcher Johnson’s glass eye caught the light through his office window, a shark’s dead stare tracking her progress. She slipped into her desk, tucking Rex’s matchbook beneath a stack of Mayor Kensington’s “Clean Streets Initiative” drafts.  </p>
<p>“Sinclair!” Fletcher’s roar cut through the newsroom din. “My office. Now.”  </p>
<p>The glass walls vibrated as he slammed a fist on his desk. “Kensington’s speech. Where is it?”  </p>
<p>“Buried next to his integrity.” She tossed the flimsy pages at him. “He’s using the initiative to launder construction funds. The docks—”  </p>
<p>“The docks ain’t payin’ your rent.” He leaned forward, his breath reeking of pickled eggs and regret. “Your old man chased shadows too. Look where it got him.”  </p>
<p>Her thumb found the watch in her pocket. <em>Tick-tick-tick.</em>  </p>
<p>“Give me two days. If I don’t find proof, I’ll write your damn puff piece.”  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s glass eye glinted. “One day. And if you’re wrong, you’re coverin’ petticoats at Macy’s Parade.”  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>12:08 PM | Alley Behind The Sapphire Rabbit</strong>  </p>
<p>Rain slicked the bricks as Viv pressed Eddie Malone against the wall, her switchblade pricking his thigh. His eyes darted to the lion crest ring on his pinky—Mayor Kensington’s family symbol.  </p>
<p>“Mr. X says you know where the throne’s hidden.”  </p>
<p>Sweat glistened above his lip. “I want fifty bucks.”  </p>
<p>“I want a world without men who stink of fish guts. We don’t always get what we want.”  </p>
<p>A door creaked open. A man with spiderweb tattoos coiled up his neck—Sammy Delgado—nodded toward the harbor. “Cops’ll fish what’s left of you from the river if you keep yappin’, Eddie.”  </p>
<p>The dockworker swallowed. “Red Hook. Dock 9. Midnight.”  </p>
<p>Viv stepped back, tucking the blade into her garter. Eddie’s rosary tangled in her fingers as he fled, the beads still warm from his panic.  </p>
<p>Back in her apartment, she struck a match. Mayor Kensington’s speech curled into ash in the sink.  </p>
<p>“Rot in hell,” she whispered, but the words tasted like her father’s blood.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p><strong>1:14 PM | Bellevue Morgue</strong>  </p>
<p>The attendant didn’t blink when Viv flashed her press badge. “Slab 4. Cyanide’s a bitch, ain’t it?”  </p>
<p>Eddie Malone’s face had turned the color of spoiled milk, lips cherry-red and split. She pressed the rosary into his stiffened hand.  </p>
<p>“Who gave you the throne’s location?” she asked the corpse.  </p>
<p>A throat cleared behind her. Inspector Bobbie Burns loomed in the doorway, nicotine gum cracking between his teeth. “Let it go, Sinclair. Unless you wanna join him.”  </p>
<p>Her father’s watch ticked louder.  </p>
