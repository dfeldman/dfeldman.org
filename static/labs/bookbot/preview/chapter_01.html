                <h1>Chapter 1: Empty Pedestral</h1>
<p>Smoke curled from my cigarette as I stared at the void where Byzantine emperors once sat. The Golden Throne’s pedestal hadn’t changed in three years—same black velvet shroud, same brass plaque tarnished by the breath of gawkers. I flicked ash onto the Kensington Museum’s marble floor. Let the docents tut.  </p>
<p>“Miss Sinclair.” Gus’s wheeze preceded him around the Corinthian column. His flashlight trembled in rheumatic hands. “We close in ten.”  </p>
<p>I didn’t turn. The dagger of his knowledge—that he’d been on duty that night too—pressed between my shoulder blades. “You ever hear anything else? About the theft?”  </p>
<p>His throat rattled. “Administration said not to talk.”  </p>
<p>“But you want to.” I caught his reflection in the glass case behind me. The dumb guilt in his bloodshot eyes.  </p>
<p>He shuffled closer, reeking of Ben-Gay and rye. “Basement door’s been…whispering. Last Tuesday.” A cough shook his hunched frame. “Like someone dragging chains.”  </p>
<p>My pulse leapt. <em>Uncle Arthur’s ghost,</em> the superstitious part of me whispered. The part that still saw his bloated face in the East River whenever I closed my eyes.  </p>
<p>I crushed the cigarette under my oxford. “Tell me where.”  </p>
<p>The grand staircase creaked. Gus melted into shadows as a pair of interns descended, their laughter too bright for the tomb-quiet halls.  </p>
<p>“Miss Sinclair!” Fletcher’s voice carried the edge of a man who’d shouted down riots. “My office. Now.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The <em>New York Star</em> newsroom swam in honeyed light and sweat. Teletype machines clattered like vengeful spirits. Fletcher stood at his cracked leather desk, ink bleeding through the society page draft in his fist.  </p>
<p>“Beaumont’s gala.” He thrust the paper at me. “Tonight. Whitefields Estate.”  </p>
<p>I leaned against the doorframe. “You’re giving me glitter and hors d'oeuvres?”  </p>
<p>“Charles Beaumont’s importing ‘art benefactors’ from Marseille.” His index finger stabbed the guest list—a who’s who of bankers and bootleggers. “Word is the Moretti crew’s laundering through his gallery.”  </p>
<p>The name hit like a gut punch. <em>Moretti.</em> The same family who’d paid a certain security guard to look the other way in ’26. The guard whose body they pulled from the river six days later.  </p>
<p>“I need sources, not society drivel.”  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s laugh smelled of bourbon and bronchitis. “Kid, drivel pays your rent.” He tossed me a press pass. “Be there by eight. And Viv?” His gaze softened a fracture. “Don’t pick fights with waiters.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>My apartment greeted me with mildew and silence. I shrugged off my suspenders, the cotton sticking to my skin. The icebox yielded half a grapefruit and a bottle of Bathtub Ring gin. I drank straight from the neck.  </p>
<p>Three years. Three years since the headlines crucified Arthur Sinclair as the Kensington Mole. Since I’d found the farewell note hidden in my copy of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>—<em>They made me do it, Vivvie. Forgive me.</em>  </p>
<p>The Remington waited on the desk, its keys gleaming like rotten teeth. I fed in a fresh sheet.  </p>
<p>The carriage jerked.  </p>
<p>A slip of onionskin paper fluttered to the floor.  </p>
<p>Ice flooded my veins.  </p>
<p><em>DON’T LOOK</em>  </p>
<p>The typed words blurred. I sank into the armchair, springs biting my thighs. My name curled at the bottom in familiar, spidery cursive—Arthur’s handwriting.  </p>
<p>But that wasn’t possible.  </p>
<p>The gin rose bitter in my throat as I angled the page toward the light. A single phrase glowed beneath his signature, written in lemon juice—his old trick for passing me notes during church sermons.  </p>
<p><em>The Throne isn’t lost—it’s currency.</em>  </p>
<p>Outside, the El train screamed.</p>
