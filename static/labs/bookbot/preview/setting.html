<p>The story of Rex unfolds in the early 1960s, a decade marked by significant social change and cultural revolution. This period, characterized by the rise of civil rights movements and the burgeoning counterculture, creates a backdrop of both conflict and hope. In the small town of Willow Creek, where our story is set, the winds of change are just beginning to stir, bringing with them whispers of progress and the promise of a new era.</p>

Just beyond the town limits, vast fields stretch towards the horizon, dotted with barns and grazing cattle, embodying the rustic charm and pastoral beauty of rural America.</p>
<p>Rex's home is a charming, weathered farmhouse on the outskirts of town. Surrounded by a picket fence and a sprawling yard, it's a haven for adventure and exploration.
