                <p><strong># Chapter 3: The Art of Disappearing</strong>  </p>
<p>Delancey Street hunted corpses. I counted twelve moldering mattresses in the tenement’s foyer, springs curled like fossilized ribcages. The address from Rex’s matchbook leered in peeling gilt numbers above a door boarded with nails rusted to sepia tears. My flashlight beam sliced through grime-coated air. Blood spatter clung to the walls, old as sin.  </p>
<p>“Nowhere to go but down,” I whispered to Arthur’s ghost. He’d preferred attics.  </p>
<p>The coal chute crouched behind a cairn of firebricks, its iron hinges shrieking betrayal. I slid into the void, knees scraping through a century of soot. My blouse caught on a nail, tearing free with the sound of a violinist’s last breath.  </p>
<p>Greenish light flickered below.  </p>
<p>The tunnels stank of wet earth and ozone. Narrow-gauge tracks gleamed under bare bulbs strung like witchlights. I pressed against a sweating brick pillar as voices echoed.  </p>
<p>“…Thursday’s shipment,” growled a sandpapered baritone. “Throne goes to the docks, same as the Rembrandt.”  </p>
<p>A younger voice: “Who’s moving it?”  </p>
<p>“Same bastards who shut Lowell’s trap permanent.” Ragged laughter. “Boss don’t care if we sail it or sink it, long as the mayor gets paid.”  </p>
<p><em>Mayor.</em> My pulse thrummed. The flashlight slipped in my clammy grip.  </p>
<p>A distant train horn drowned their retreating footsteps. Silence rushed in, thick as clotting blood. My beam trembled over tracks, then caught on something pale.  </p>
<p>A hand.  </p>
<p>The subway worker lay sprawled like a broken marionette, left arm twisted behind him, right fist clenched. I pried open his rigor-mortis fingers. A slip of paper—<em>Grand Central. Thursday, 11:15 PM. Track B-12.</em>  </p>
<p>His throat grinned sideways.  </p>
<p>Gin surged up my own. I retched into the coal dust.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p><strong>“I’ve been threatened by better,”</strong> I lied.  </p>
<p>Fletcher’s pencil snapped. Gold whiskey trembled on his mustache. “They mentioned your uncle. Said if I didn’t bury this story, they’d send Arthur a playmate.”  </p>
<p>The <em>Star</em>’s newsroom buzzed behind us, telewriters clattering like distant artillery.  </p>
<p>“You’re off the case.” His ink-stained fingers drummed a Morse code of fear.  </p>
<p>I slapped the train schedule on his desk. Blood smeared the page. “Tell that to the corpse in the tunnels.”  </p>
<p>He didn’t look up. “Funeral’s Friday. Bring lilies.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>Rain lashed the library’s leaded windows. Eleanor Brooks emerged from the stacks, a cameo brooch pinned at her throat like a preserved scar.  </p>
<p>“Tunnels, you say?” She unrolled a yellowed map, her voice as dry as the parchment. “Built for coal in ’58. Retrofitted during Prohibition.” Her nail traced a spiderweb beneath Fifth Avenue. “Smugglers use them to bypass checkpoints.”  </p>
<p>I pointed to Delancey Street. “Where does this spur lead?”  </p>
<p>“Docks.” She folded the map with surgical precision. “But you didn’t hear that from me.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>My apartment reeked of betrayal. I tossed the schedule onto the desk, poured two fingers of bathtub gin, and froze.  </p>
<p>Shadows moved.  </p>
<p>“Late for a social call, isn’t it?” My Derringer found the darkness.  </p>
<p>Vito stepped into the jaundiced glow of my desk lamp. Rain glistened on his shoulders. “You missed the memo, doll. Warrens are Moretti turf.”  </p>
<p>“What’s the penalty for trespassing these days?”  </p>
<p>He plucked the glass from my hand, swallowed the gin in one motion. “Depends. You hoping for a spanking or a bullet?”  </p>
<p>Sandalwood cut through the mildew. Closer now.  </p>
<p>“You’re tracking mud on my last clean rug.”  </p>
<p>He stepped over the stain. “That corpse in the tunnels? He worked for <em>my</em> crew. You’re costing me money.”  </p>
<p>“Send me a bill.”  </p>
<p>His fingers brushed the silver streak in my hair. “Or a wreath?”  </p>
<p>The kiss landed like a sucker punch—hot, brutal, gone before I could bite.  </p>
<p>He was at the door when I threw the glass. It shattered against the jamb.  </p>
<p>“You taste like secrets,” he said, and vanished into the stairwell.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The train schedule glowed under my lamp. 11:15 PM. Compartment B-12.  </p>
<p>Arthur’s pocket watch ticked on my wrist. I lit a cigarette with hands that wouldn’t steady.  </p>
<p>Somewhere below, the third-floor neighbor’s radio crooned: <em>“…the golden chair, the golden chair, the gangster’s sweet affair…”</em>  </p>
<p>I traced the dead man’s bloodstains. Gus the night guard had mentioned strange noises in the museum basement.  </p>
<p>Coal chutes. Corpses. Compartments.  </p>
<p>The typewriter keys laughed under my fingers.</p>
