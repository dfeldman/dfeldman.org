                <h1>Chapter 3: Society’s Sharp Edge</h1>
<p>The gramophone needle hissed like a cornered cat before settling into <em>Tea for Two</em>. Lydia Fitzgerald adjusted her pearl earring with the precision of a surgeon, her reflection warped in the champagne flute between them. “Darling, you look positively feral.” Her lacquered nail traced the rim of Viv’s untouched drink. “Did you crawl here through a coal chute?”  </p>
<p>Viv crossed her legs, torn stocking snagging on the Art Deco sofa’s velvet. Sutton Place townhouses didn’t smell like old money, she decided—they reeked of lemongrass polish and desperation. “Your fiancé’s yacht docks at Pier 17 every Thursday. With a <em>different</em> brunette.” She tossed the photos onto the onyx coffee table. Charles Beaumont’s hand up a Ziegfeld girl’s skirt glinted under the chandelier. “Front page material, if I were feeling charitable.”  </p>
<p>Lydia’s smile tightened. A derringer slid from her sleeve into her palm, the barrel pressing Viv’s ribcage through her moth-eaten cardigan. “Charity’s for orphans and dullards. What do you <em>want</em>?”  </p>
<p>“The Met Gala guest list.” Viv didn’t blink. “With annotations.”  </p>
<p>Ice clinked as Lydia poured herself another glass. The champagne’s almond scent made Viv’s throat burn—cyanide, maybe, or the ghost of last week’s near-drowning. “You think Kensington hides his sins in ballroom punch?”  </p>
<p>“I think he’ll be missing two emeralds by dessert.” Viv palmed the switchblade in her coat pocket, its handle slick with dockwater residue. “Your choice—scandal or obituary.”  </p>
<p>A grandfather clock choked out eight tolls. Lydia’s laugh trilled like broken glass. “Oh, I’ve missed you.” She kicked a leather-bound ledger across the table. Gold leaf on the cover spelled <em>Patrons of Antiquities</em>. “Page forty-three. But do mind the—”  </p>
<p>Viv flipped it open. A dried rose crumbled between pages, thorns still sharp enough to draw blood. She sucked her finger, copper tang mixing with Lydia’s Chanel No. 5. “Shipping manifests?”  </p>
<p>“Kensington’s <em>private gallery</em>.” Lydia’s heel ground the rose into the Persian rug. “Beneath the Met’s Egyptian wing. They say the air smells of… what’s the word? Ah, yes. <em>Betrayal.</em>”  </p>
<p>The gramophone screeched. Viv lunged sideways as Lydia’s derringer barked, blowing a hole through the ledger. Plaster snowed from the ceiling. “<em>Encore!</em>” Lydia giggled, reloading. “Do keep the photos. Charles’ corpse makes a lovely bookmark.”  </p>
<hr />
<p>Confessional booths always stank of cheap wine and cheaper regrets. Viv knelt on the splintered kneeler, the torn screen grazing her forehead. “Bless me, Father, for I’ve brought a switchblade into your house.”  </p>
<p>Father O’Malley’s wheeze rattled the partition. “Twenty years hearing confessions, and the <em>Irish Times</em> still prints my address.” His shadow shifted—a silhouette missing its left ear. “What’s Romanoff want?”  </p>
<p>“Who?”  </p>
<p>A subway token slid through the grate, warm from his palm. “The Eye sees everything.”  </p>
<p>Viv pocketed the token—brass edges worn smooth, the <em>City Hall Station</em> engraving half-scraped away. “I need names. Dockworkers, art handlers—”  </p>
<p>“You need a bulletproof corset.” The priest’s cough became a wet chuckle. “Ask your boyfriend.”  </p>
<p>She froze. A scrap of paper fluttered to the floor, Psalm 62:8 scribbled in grease pencil: <em>Trust in him at all times, you people.</em> The handwriting matched the train timetable Vito had slipped her in the alley.  </p>
<p>The curtain ripped open. Viv stumbled into the nave, moonlight strafing the crucifix. A shadow detached from the Virgin Mary’s statue—Vito, lighting a cigarette off the eternal flame. “You followed me.”  </p>
<p>“You’re lousy at tailing.” He blew smoke at the stained glass martyrs. “Kensington’s boys found Eddie’s body.”  </p>
<p>The rosary burned in her pocket. “And?”  </p>
<p>“They’re tagging your apartment tonight.” His gaze dropped to her bleeding palm—the ledger’s rose thorn cut. “Got a death wish, Red?”  </p>
<p>She pressed the subway token into his scarred knuckles. “Just a craving for answers.”  </p>
<p>His thumb brushed her wrist. For a heartbeat, the church held its breath. Then the sacristy door slammed. Footsteps echoed—police-issue boots. Vito melted into the shadows, his warning trailing behind: “Ditch the cyanide breath.”  </p>
<p>Viv touched her lips. Bitter almonds. <em>Lydia’s champagne.</em>  </p>
<p>She spat into the holy water font and ran.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>The tenement stairs groaned under Viv’s weight, each creak a potential trigger. She paused on the fourth-floor landing, ear pressed to her apartment door—no voices, no clink of glass. Just the icebox’s arrhythmic hum.  </p>
<p>Key in the lock.  </p>
<p>A scent hit her first: jasmine and gun oil. Rex Donovan sat at her kitchen table, a dossier spread between half-empty gin bottles. “You’ve been busy.” He tossed a photo of Lydia’s ledger into her sink. “Since when do you waltz with vipers?”  </p>
<p>Viv kicked the door shut. “Since they started nesting in City Hall.” She flipped through the dossier—grainy shots of Kensington at Dock 9, a typed list of “sanitation expenses” that could buy a battleship. “Where’d you get this?”  </p>
<p>“Friend at the FBI.” Rex’s glass eye caught the lamplight, a spiderweb crack distorting his pupil. “They’re circling. But you?” He nodded at her bulletin board—Eddie’s rosary pinned next to subway maps. “You’re diving headfirst into the meat grinder.”  </p>
<p>She uncorked the gin. “Dad’s notes mentioned a curator. Someone who authenticated the throne after the heist.”  </p>
<p>Rex’s jaw tightened. “Marty Finnegan. Jumped from the Woolworth Building last November.”  </p>
<p>“Or was pushed.” Viv traced the rosary’s cross. “I need access to the Met’s employee files.”  </p>
<p>“You need a hospital.” He grabbed her wrist, thumb pressing the pulse point. “Your hands are shaking.”  </p>
<p>The admission hung between them, brittle as the bulb flickering above. Viv pulled free. “I’ll sleep when Kensington’s rotting in Sing Sing.”  </p>
<p>A floorboard creaked overhead. Rex drew his revolver. “Expecting company?”  </p>
<p>The fire escape window exploded.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>Glass shards rained down as Viv ducked behind the icebox. A gloved hand groped through the broken pane, fumbling the latch. Rex fired twice—drywall erupted in bursts of white dust. “Back door!” he barked.  </p>
<p>Viv kicked aside the rug, yanking open the hidden floor compartment. Dad’s old police revolver lay oiled and loaded. “Since when do you play bodyguard?”  </p>
<p>“Since you became the story.” Rex reloaded, sweat staining his collar. “Move!”  </p>
<p>They burst onto the fire escape. June heat hit like a furnace blast. Below, two thugs with sawed-offs crouched behind a Model T. “That’s Paulie’s crew!” Viv shouted.  </p>
<p>“Merry Christmas.” Rex shoved her down the ladder as the first shotgun blast took out the railing.  </p>
<p>They hit the alley running. Viv’s heel snapped; she limped past overflowing trash cans, Rex’s wheezing close behind. A bullet nicked her ear. She returned fire blindly, the revolver’s kick numbing her wrist.  </p>
<p>“Here!” Rex yanked her into a speakeasy’s side entrance—<em>The Pink Flamingo</em>, according to the peeling mural of a dancing bird. The bartender didn’t look up as they vaulted the counter.  </p>
<p>“Through the kitchen!”  </p>
<p>Meat hooks swayed in the freezer’s blue light. Rex barricaded the door with a side of beef. “Plan B?”  </p>
<p>Viv pried open a coal chute. “Don’t die.”  </p>
<p>They slid into darkness.</p>
