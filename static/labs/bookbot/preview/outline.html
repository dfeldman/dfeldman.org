<h4><strong>Scene 1: The Metropolitan Museum Heist Gallery</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Setting</strong>: Gallery 17, 10:00 AM. Summer heat sears through cracked stained glass, pooling sweat under Vivian’s collar. Dust motes swirl in shafts of light, catching on the gilded edges of empty frames.<br />
<strong>Characters</strong>: Vivian (alone, armed with a Leica camera), Guard Joe (shiftily adjusting his holster), Celeste (disguised as a docent, paint under her fingernails).<br />
<strong>Key Beats</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Sensual Memory</strong>: Vivian’s fingertips trace her father’s initials carved into the marble base of the Golden Throne replica. <em>His Old Spice lingers in her mind—sandalwood and regret.</em> A bead of sweat slides between her breasts.<br />
2. <strong>Discovery</strong>: The throne’s gilding flakes under her nails—<em>fresh glue glistens, still tacky</em>. A shadow shifts behind a tapestry. She freezes, her camera strap biting into her neck.<br />
3. <strong>Romantic Foreshadowing</strong>: Vito leans against the doorway, sunlight catching the silver lighter in his hand. Their eyes lock. Heat prickles her neck. He tosses the lighter to her—<em>it lands at her feet, engraved “Rosa.”</em> “Careful, Red,” he drawls. “Curiosity’s a killer.”<br />
4. <strong>Violence</strong>: A thug lunges from the shadows. Switchblade grazes her thigh. She disarms him, slamming his head into the throne. <em>Blood drips onto Byzantine mosaics.</em> The scent of copper floods her nostrils.<br />

<strong>Key Beats</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Erotic Tension</strong>: Vito dabs iodine on her thigh. <em>His breath hitches as her skirt rides higher.</em> “You cost me a grand tonight,” he lies, fingers skimming the lace edge of her stocking.<br />
2. <strong>Violence</strong>: Thug gropes her—<em>Vito breaks his nose with a bottle.</em> Enzo’s laughter booms from the shadows. “Teach her respect, boy.” Glass crunches under Vito’s boots as he steps closer, eyes dark.<br />
3. <strong>Clue</strong>: Torn manifest in the thug’s pocket: <em>“Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight. Eyes only.”</em> The paper reeks of saltwater and diesel.  </p>

3. <strong>Romantic Tension</strong>: Vivian bandages Vito’s bullet graze in the cart’s flickering light. <em>His thumb brushes her lip.</em> “Why’d you follow me?” She yanks the bandage tight. “You’re a terrible liar.” The cart jolts—<em>their bodies press together, breath mingling with the stench of gunpowder.</em>  </p>
