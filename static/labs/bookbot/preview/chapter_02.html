                <h1>Chapter 2: Whispers in the Rain</h1>
<p>The Sapphire Rabbit’s blue gas lamps cast shadows like liquid night. Viv pressed her spine against the bar’s splintered edge, Sammy Delgado’s warning buzzing in her skull: <em>“You got ten minutes before the fuzz rolls in.”</em> A trumpeter’s mournful wail drowned the clink of ice in bootleg bourbon. She watched the door, her switchblade a cold kiss against her thigh.  </p>
<p>“He’s late.”  </p>
<p>Sammy polished a highball glass, spiderweb tattoo stretching as he nodded toward the alley exit. “Malone’s a rat sniffing two cheeses. Wants your cash <em>and</em> Kensington’s.”  </p>
<p>The door creaked open. Eddie Malone slouched in, rain dripping from his newsboy cap. His eyes darted like cornered mice—left, right, to the rosary clenched in his fist. Viv’s pulse throbbed where Dad’s pocket watch pressed her breastbone. <em>Three years.</em> Three years since the throne vanished, since guards started dropping like gutted fish. She slid onto the stool beside Eddie.  </p>
<p>“Fifty.” He reeked of fish guts and fear.  </p>
<p>Viv fanned the bills under the table. “Start talking.”  </p>
<p>Eddie’s pinky ring caught the light—a lion crest swallowed by a crown. <em>Kensington’s symbol.</em> “Mayor’s got a shipment leaving Dock 9 tonight. Crated up like machine parts.” His thumb worked the rosary beads. “Your sparkly chair’s eyes… they’re onboard.”  </p>
<p>She pressed the switchblade to his leg. “Who’s moving them?”  </p>
<p>“Some guinea named Vito.” The blade bit through wool. Eddie hissed. “Works for Paulie.”  </p>
<p>The trumpeter hit a sour note. Viv followed Eddie’s twitch toward the fire exit. “Why rat out Kensington?”  </p>
<p>“Ain’t family if they don’t share the pie.” His laugh curdled. “He promised my ma—”  </p>
<p>Glass shattered.  </p>
<p>Paulie Moretti filled the doorway, garlic breath preceding him like a storm front. A Thompson gun hung loose at his side. “Well, lookit. The reporter bitch and a turncoat.”  </p>
<p>Eddie lunged. Viv’s blade sank into his thigh as the first bullets tore through the bourbon bottles. She hit the floor, whiskey and blood soaking her stockings.  </p>
<p>“Sinclair!”  </p>
<p>A hand clamped her wrist—knuckles scarred, grip iron-strong. Vito Romano dragged her into the alley, rain slashing his face. Neon from the <em>Deliveries Only</em> sign painted his cheekbones hell-red. “Run.”  </p>
<p>Gunfire chased them through labyrinthine puddles. Viv’s heel caught a carcass—rat or human?—as Vito shoved her behind a dumpster. His body pinned hers, heat cutting through the rain-chill. Paulie’s voice boomed off the bricks.  </p>
<p>“Got a present for you, Viv!” A wet thud. Eddie’s corpse hit the pavement, rosary still tangled in his fingers.  </p>
<p>Vito’s breath warmed her ear. “Breathe through your nose.”  </p>
<p>She inhaled rust and his cologne—bay rum and gunpowder. Paulie’s boots splashed closer.  </p>
<p>“You ain’t saving her, V!”  </p>
<p>Vito’s hand slid under his coat. Viv tensed. <em>Luger? Stiletto?</em> He pulled out a train timetable.  </p>
<p>“Midnight freight to Albany,” he whispered. “Board car seven.”  </p>
<p>Her nails dug into his wrist. “Why help me?”  </p>
<p>“You’re bad for business.” His smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Now <em>shut up.</em>”  </p>
<p>Paulie cocked his Thompson. “Come out, and I’ll make it qui—”  </p>
<p>A police whistle pierced the night. Boots pounded the street.  </p>
<p>“Fuzz!” Paulie spat. “This ain’t over, Red.”  </p>
<p>Silence.  </p>
<p>Viv pushed Vito off. “Your boss?”  </p>
<p>“My problem.” He straightened his tie, eyes on Eddie’s body. “Touch the throne again, and they’ll find you in pieces.”  </p>
<p>Rain washed the blood from Viv’s hem as she crouched by Eddie. The rosary beads left indentations in his palm—<em>Sinner’s guilt.</em> She pried it loose.  </p>
<p>Vito watched. “You pray?”  </p>
<p>“I collect evidence.”  </p>
<p>He laughed—dark, weary. “Evidence dies here, <em>capisce?</em>”  </p>
<p>Viv pocketed the rosary. “So do promises.”  </p>
<p>She vanished into the storm, the timetable burning against her ribs. Three blocks east, under a flickering streetlamp, she unfolded Vito’s “gift.” A shipping manifest fell out—<strong>DOCK 9 - VATICAN HOLDINGS - 6/4/29</strong>.  </p>
<p>The throne’s emeralds blinked in her mind like cat eyes.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<hr />
<p>Shadows moved in the warehouse across the pier. Viv counted six guards patrolling Dock 9, their silhouettes backlit by the freighter’s floodlights. The <em>S.S. Vaticano</em> loomed like a steel tomb, its chains clanking against the midnight tide. She crouched behind a pallet of “agricultural tools”—crates stamped with Kensington’s lion crest.  </p>
<p>A cigarette flared.  </p>
<p>“You’re either brave or brainless.”  </p>
<p>Viv froze. Vito stepped from the gloom, his suit jacket speckled with rain. “This ain’t your fight, girl.”  </p>
<p>“It’s <em>always</em> been my fight.” She nodded at the freighter. “Why crates to Rome?”  </p>
<p>“Export tax loopholes. You’d need a week and a whiskey to understand.”  </p>
<p>“And the throne’s eyes?”  </p>
<p>He hesitated. “Kensington’s obsessed. Says they… whisper.”  </p>
<p>The scar on her collarbone itched. “You heard them?”  </p>
<p>“I hear paychecks.” His gaze flicked to the manifest in her hand. “Leave before Paulie smells you.”  </p>
<p>Boots crunched gravel.  </p>
<p>Vito cursed in Italian, shoving her into the harbor’s ink-black embrace. Icy water stole her breath. Above, Paulie’s laughter rolled like thunder.  </p>
<p>“Got a new game, V! Let’s see if rats float!”  </p>
<p>The first bullet kissed the waves beside her ear. Viv dove, saltwater stinging her eyes. When she surfaced, gasping, the dock was chaos—flames licking the <em>Vaticano</em>’s hull, guards shouting in three languages.  </p>
<p>Vito leaned over the pier, hand outstretched. “Now or never, Red!”  </p>
<p>She reached. Missed.  </p>
<p>A wave slammed her into the pilings. The rosary tangled in the barnacles—<em>Eddie’s last confession.</em> She tore it free as the current dragged her under.  </p>
<p>Strong hands hauled her up. Vito’s arm locked around her waist, his breath ragged. “You’re gonna get us both killed.”  </p>
<p>Her lips found his ear. “But what a headline.”  </p>
<p>Sirens wailed. He let go.  </p>
<p>“Stay out of the tunnels,” he warned, vanishing into smoke.  </p>
<p>Viv washed ashore two piers down, the manifest disintegrating in her fist. Only one line remained legible: <em>EMERALD EYES - VATICAN VAULT 12.</em>  </p>
<p>The throne’s curse hummed in her veins.</p>
