                <h1>Chapter 2: Whispers in the Rain</h1>
<p>The Sapphire Rabbit’s blue gas lamps cast long shadows across Eddie Malone’s twitching jaw. He sat wedged in the speakeasy’s back booth, fingers worrying a rosary beneath the table. Bourbon sweat gleamed on his forehead. Viv slid into the seat opposite him, the .32 revolver in her purse digging into her thigh.  </p>
<p>“You’re late,” Eddie muttered. His pinky ring caught the light—gold lion crest, same as the Mayor’s campaign buttons.  </p>
<p>Viv tossed a fifty-dollar bill bundle on the table. The trumpeter’s mute couldn’t drown the <em>click</em> of her switchblade springing open under the table. The tip pressed against Eddie’s denim-clad leg. “Talk fast. Who’s moving Kensington’s crates?”  </p>
<p>A waitress passed with a tray of absinthe frappés. Eddie waited for her hips to sway out of earshot. “Vito Romano. Moretti’s top button man. He’s been—”  </p>
<p>Gunfire erupted upstairs.  </p>
<p>Viv ducked as plaster rained from the ceiling. The jazz band scattered, the trumpet landing with a dissonant wail. Eddie lunged for the fire exit, rosary beads scattering. She caught his wrist. “You set me up!”  </p>
<p>“I didn’t know they’d send <em>Paulie</em>!” He yanked free, bull-rushing the door.  </p>
<p>A silhouette filled the stairwell—broad shoulders, scarred knuckles gripping a Thompson. Viv recognized Paulie Moretti from Fletcher’s mob beat photos. Garlic and cordite clogged her nostrils as he leveled the barrel.  </p>
<p>“Eddie!” she screamed.  </p>
<p>Too  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>late. Three bullets punched through Eddie’s back, slamming him into the jukebox. <em>St. James Infirmary</em> skipped, the needle screeching over his death rattle. Viv dove behind the bar as bullets chewed the mahogany. Shards of rum bottles exploded, stinging her cheeks.  </p>
<p>A hand clamped over her mouth. “Don’t. Breathe.” The voice was low, Sicilian. Vito Romano dragged her into the stockroom, his suit reeking of bergamot and gunpowder.  </p>
<p>Paulie’s boots crunched glass. “Find the dame!”  </p>
<p>Vito pressed Viv against pickle barrels, his thigh trapping hers. Moonlight through a high window caught the scar bisecting his brow. “You cost me fifty grand, reporter.”  </p>
<p>She drove her knee upward. He blocked it, chuckling. “Feisty. Your father’s eyes, but your mother’s left hook—Clara Sinclair, right? Worked the Roosevelt Library.”  </p>
<p>The air left her lungs. “How do you—”  </p>
<p>Paulie kicked the stockroom door. Vito smashed a jar of pickled cauliflower over the thug’s head, grabbed Viv’s hand, and sprinted into the alley. Rain needled her face, mingling with the copper tang of Eddie’s blood on her blouse.  </p>
<p>“Dock 9,” Viv panted, skidding on wet cobblestones. “The throne’s there tonight, isn’t it?”  </p>
<p>Vito shoved her behind a coal chute as Paulie’s bullets sparked. “Asking about that thing’ll get you—”  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>crowned with a tombstone, <em>cara.</em>” He returned fire, the Luger’s report echoing between tenements. A neon sign flickered <strong>DELIVERIES ONLY</strong>, painting his scowl hellish red.  </p>
<p>Viv’s fingers found Eddie’s rosary in her pocket—half the beads snapped off during the chase. She wondered which saint watched over backstabbing dockworkers.  </p>
<p>Paulie reloaded. Vito seized the moment, dragging her toward a Model T idling in the fog. “Keep up or die.”  </p>
<p>The realization hit as her torn stockings snagged on broken glass: <em>He’s stealing Kensington’s getaway car.</em> The trunk overflowed with crates stamped <strong>VATICAN HOLDINGS</strong>. Viv glimpsed a ledger poking from Vito’s waistband—shipping dates? Routes?  </p>
<p>Paulie’s final bullet shattered the rear window as Vito floored it. Viv clutched the dashboard, her pulse thrumming faster than the engine. “Why save me?”  </p>
<p>He lit a cigarette with a match from The Sapphire Rabbit. “Dead reporters can’t pay debts.”  </p>
<p>Rain blurred the city into a wash of grays. Somewhere behind them, the Golden Throne’s emerald eyes glowed in the dark—patient, hungry.  </p>
