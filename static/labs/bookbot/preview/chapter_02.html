                <h1>Chapter 2: Whiskey and Razorblades</h1>
<p>The Oasis stank of bad decisions. I ducked through the butcher shop’s hanging beef carcasses, their bloody hooks glinting like accusation fingers. A false wall groaned open behind the liverwurst display. Blue smoke slapped me first—cheap cigars and the sweet rot of bootleg gin. Then came the sawdust tang of spilled blood.  </p>
<p>Rex Donovan sat in the back booth, nursing rye from a jar labeled <em>Pig’s Feet</em>. His shoulders swallowed the space, a mountain gone to seed. He didn’t look up as I slid in. “You’re late.”  </p>
<p>“And you’re a cliché.” I snatched his drink, the liquor burning like a struck match. “What’s so urgent a girl has to skip her beauty sleep?”  </p>
<p>His thumb jabbed toward the bar. Sammy Delgado polished glasses with a rag that’d never seen soap. The serpent tattoo on his neck rippled. “Your new boyfriend’s been nosing around all week,” Rex grunted. “Asking who runs the art beat at the <em>Star</em>.”  </p>
<p><strong>“Who</strong> asked?”  </p>
<p>Rex’s flask sneaked from his coat. I caught the glint of nickel plating. “Some greaseball in a sharkskin suit. Enzo Moretti’s favorite lapdog.” He tossed a matchbook onto the table. Waterfront address scribbled on the back. “Delancey Street. It’s a knife magnet.”  </p>
<p>I pocketed the matches. “Come with me. Split the scoop.”  </p>
<p>“I don’t file reports for Fletcher’s fishwrap.” His laugh rattled loose change. “You been tailed?”  </p>
<p>“Only by ghosts.”  </p>
<p>He leaned in. Whiskey and Sen-Sen overwhelmed the speakeasy stench. “Your uncle wasn’t no thief, Viv. But digging up that coffin gets you two things—a bullet or a body bag.”  </p>
<p>The door to the butcher shop creaked open. Cold air razored through the haze. Rex stiffened. “Back exit. Now.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>Rain needled my neck as I stumbled into the alley. Garbage festered in puddles. My fingers found the Derringer in my garter just as a voice purred through the downpour. “Running from shadows, doll?”  </p>
<p>Vito Romano leaned against a brick wall, flicking a silver dollar across his knuckles. His suit clung too well, sharp enough to draw blood. I stepped back. “Who’s paying you to lurk in the dark? Moretti?”  </p>
<p>The coin froze midair. “You say his name like it’s a curse. Could be we’re on the same side.”  </p>
<p>“Do thieves have sides now?”  </p>
<p>His laugh hummed against wet skin. “We’ve got better wardrobes than cops.” He pushed off the wall. Rain sluiced down his jaw. My throat tightened.  </p>
<p>“Let’s trade.” He blocked my path. Heat radiated through his soaked shirt. “You tell me why Kensington’s pet project died with your uncle. I tell you why his corpse floats in every speakeasy confession.”  </p>
<p>I spat at his wingtip. “Only corpse here’s yours if you don’t move.”  </p>
<p>He reached for my collar. Calluses snagged the silk. “You’ve got—” His thumb brushed my pulse point. “Lint.”  </p>
<p>The slap echoed. His head snapped sideways, but the grin stayed. “Attagirl.”  </p>
<p>We stood chest to chest, breath tangling. His sandalwood cologne warred with the alley’s decay. Thunder cannonballed overhead. He pressed the silver dollar into my palm. “For the subway, <em>principessa</em>. Looks like you’ll need it.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>My drenched clothes clung like a second skin. Rex’s matchbook dissolved in my hand as I stared at the boarded-up tenement. The Delancey Street address bled ink. Above me, a gargoyle vomited rainwater.  </p>
<p>Inside my apartment, I peeled off my stockings. The telegram slithered from my coat pocket.  </p>
<p><em>Dear Miss Sinclair—</em><br />
<em>Urban Renewal Comm. records enclosed. Follow the tracks.</em><br />
<em>—A Friend</em>  </p>
<p>The ledger page fluttered to the floor—seven grand diverted from “Public Works” to “Art Preservation LLC” last month. Serial numbers from Kensington’s vault.  </p>
<p>I poured a bath of gin. Drank half. The other half stung my split knuckles. Through the steam, Vito’s smirk haunted the mirror.  </p>
<p><em>Currency.</em>  </p>
<p>Arthur’s lemon-juice ghost whispered as I sank beneath the surface.  </p>
