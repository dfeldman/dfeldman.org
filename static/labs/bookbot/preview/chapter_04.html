                <p><strong># Chapter 4: Society’s Sharp Edges</strong>  </p>
<p>The ballroom stank of gardenias and greed. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto acres of sequined spite, each gown costlier than a tenement’s yearly rent. I adjusted my borrowed pearls—paste replicas that chafed like the lie they were—and wove through champagne tides. Lydia Fitzgerald awaited me by the grand piano, her ice-blonde chignon sharp enough to slit throats.  </p>
<p>“Darling!” She air-kissed my cheek, her breath sweet with vermouth. “You simply must try the <em>canapés</em>. The pâté is <em>divine</em>—I hear they liquored up the geese before slaughter.” Her fingernails bit into my wrist as she leaned closer. “Second button’s loose on your glove. Amateurs always miss the details.”  </p>
<p>The piano launched into a jaunty Cole Porter. A waiter glided past; I snagged two coupes of champagne. “How’d you know I’d come?”  </p>
<p>Lydia’s smile was a scalpel. “Because your press pass tears crookedly, dear. The <em>Star</em> doesn’t starch its collars.” She sipped, leaving a crimson half-moon on the glass. “Also, Fletcher owes me a favor. Something involving a Senator’s <em>indiscretion</em> and a borzoi.”  </p>
<p>A marble-columned mirror caught our reflection: we could’ve been sisters, if despair were a shade of lipstick. She saw me notice. “The Mayor’s wife had that installed. She likes to watch her guests stab backs mid-waltz.”  </p>
<p>I deposited my empty flute on a passing tray. “Why help me?”  </p>
<p>“Kensington called my father’s suicide a ‘tax dodge’ at the Darby Ball.” Her thumb grazed the cameo at her throat—real, unlike mine. “Now. Three o’clock. Freddie Winslow’s about to disgrace himself by the potted ivy.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>Freddie swayed like a metronome set to <em>disaster</em>. Monocle fogged, ascot askew, he clutched a magnum of Dom Pérignon like a newborn. “Vivi! Vivace! <em>Vixen!</em>” Champagne sloshed onto my T-straps as he engulfed me. “Heard you’re hunting ghosts! Did’ya know the mayor’s got a <em>pet</em>? Choo-choos to <em>nowhere</em>, fulla’ <em>art</em> or some rot!”  </p>
<p>I steadied him. “Slow down, Freddie. Which nowhere?”  </p>
<p>“Whitefields!” He hiccuped. “But the throne’s not there. Lost luggage. Or legs? Leggy legs—” His gaze snagged on a waiter’s tight trousers. I yanked his chin back.  </p>
<p>“When’s the next train?”  </p>
<p>“Thursday.” His hand found my waist. “Ride with me, Viv. I’ll show you the <em>compartments</em>—”  </p>
<p>The chandelier dimmed. Across the room, Enzo Moretti’s pockmarked face glowed in match-light as he lit a cigar. Two gorillas in tuxedos flanked him, necks thicker than their skulls.  </p>
<p>Vito materialized at my elbow. “You’re lost, doll. Kitten’s pen’s upstairs.” He gripped my arm, silk sleeve sliding over taut muscle.  </p>
<p>Freddie sneered. “Piss off, greaseball.”  </p>
<p>Vito headbutted him. Freddie folded into the ivy, snoring.  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>The closet smelled of mothballs and murder. Vito shoved me inside, one palm clamped over my mouth. His thumb brushed my lower lip. “Yell and I’ll gag you proper.”  </p>
<p>Shoes clattered past the door. “…check the terrace,” snarled a voice like gravel in a meat grinder. “Boss wants the snoop gutted.”  </p>
<p>Vito’s body pinned mine against brooms. Sandalwood and gunpowder. Heat radiated through his shirt. My Derby hat tilted, veil catching on his stubble.  </p>
<p>“You’re stupid in lace.” His breath scorched my ear. “That dress hides a wire?”  </p>
<p>I kneed his thigh. He grunted, trapping my leg between his. “What’s Moretti’s stake in Kensington’s train?”  </p>
<p>A chuckle vibrated through me. “You’re playing with fire, doll.”  </p>
<p>Outside, Enzo’s thugs argued over Freddie’s prone form. “…wake him. The Eel wants names.”  </p>
<p>Vito’s teeth grazed my earlobe. Not gentle. “Stick to society pages.”  </p>
<p>“Or what? You’ll <em>spank</em> me?”  </p>
<p>“Tempting.” He leaned back just enough for light to slit his smirk. “But first, apologize for this—”  </p>
<p>Footsteps retreated. He released me like a thief dropping a hot watch. I lunged for the door.  </p>
<p>He blocked it. “You owe me.”  </p>
<p>“Tell your boss to send a bill.”  </p>
<p>“He don’t deal in cash. Only favors.” His finger hooked my pearls. “I’ll collect.”  </p>
<p>The snap echoed like a gunshot. Pearls rained between us.  </p>
<p>“Fakes.” He crushed one under his wingtip. “But you knew that.”  </p>
<p>———  </p>
<p>Freddie snored in a bergère chair, monocle cracked. I knelt, pretending to adjust his shoe. “Poor lamb,” I cooed to the gawking dowagers. “The bubbles went straight to his head.”  </p>
<p>My fingers slid into his breast pocket. Brass bit my palm: a key, teeth gleaming. <em>B-12</em>.  </p>
<p>The mirror showed me Lydia at the bar, waving a handkerchief in mock distress. Behind her reflection, Vito watched me through the crowd—a wolf in a Tommy gun tuxedo.  </p>
<p>He raised his empty champagne flute. <em>To the game.</em>  </p>
<p>I palmed the key. Somewhere, a train whistled.</p>
