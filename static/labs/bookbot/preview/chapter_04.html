                <h1>Chapter 4: Bodies in the Bay</h1>
<p>The morgue drawer hissed open on greased tracks, releasing a cloud of frost and decay. Viv gripped Eddie Malone’s rosary until the beads bit into her palm. Inspector Bobbie Burns chewed nicotine gum like it owed him money, his shadow stretching across Slab 4. “You sure you wanna do this, Sinclair?”  </p>
<p>She stepped forward. The toe of her oxford tapped the drain grate beneath the body—rusted from a century of blood and formaldehyde. Dawn light sliced through high windows, illuminating Eddie’s face. His skin held the waxy sheen of candle tallow, lips tinged blue.  </p>
<p>Doc Harlow adjusted his bifocals, scalpel trembling. “Cyanide,” he muttered, lifting the sheet to expose the Y-incision. “Sweet smell lingers in the bronchial tubes. Like… like marzipan left in the sun.”  </p>
<p>Viv’s stomach clenched. She pressed the rosary into Eddie’s stiff hand. The wooden cross caught the light, its edges worn smooth from decades of desperate prayers. <em>Forgive me</em>, she thought, reaching for his left pinky. The gold ring gleamed despite the grime—a lion crest above engraved Latin: <em>Sic Semper Tyrannis</em>.  </p>
<p>Burns stiffened. “That’s the Mayor’s family crest.”  </p>
<p>“His nephew,” Viv breathed. The truth hit like a sucker punch: Eddie’s darting eyes when she’d pressed the switchblade to his thigh, his refusal to name prices. <em>“He was protecting family,”</em> she realized. <em>“And I got him killed.”</em>  </p>
<p>The inspector grabbed her elbow. “Walk away, Sinclair. This case eats people.”  </p>
<p>She shook free, nostrils flaring at his bourbon-and-sweat stench. “You knew. That’s why you’ve been stonewalling my FOIA requests.”  </p>
<p>Burns’ wedding ring clicked against the drawer handle. “Kensington’s got judges in his pocket. Reporters in his incinerator.”  </p>
<p>Across the room, a telephone rang. Doc Harlow jumped, nicking his thumb. Blood bloomed on the sheet as he scurried to answer it, whispering, “Y-yes, Mr. Mayor. No, the press hasn’t—”  </p>
<p>Viv bolted.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Red Hook’s docks swam in morning fog, the East River lapping against rotting pilings. Viv leaned over the wharf, heaving coffee and guilt into the brackish water. Eddie’s ring burned through her pocket—evidence she couldn’t publish, leverage she couldn’t wield.  </p>
<p>“You look like hell, Red.”  </p>
<p>Rex Donovan materialized from the mist, his trench coat reeking of gun oil and Sen-Sen. He tossed her a handkerchief monogrammed with someone else’s initials. “Burns called. Said you’re digging your grave with both hands.”  </p>
<p>She wiped her mouth. “Since when do you care?”  </p>
<p>“Since your old man’s ghost started haunting my whiskey.” He limped closer, favoring his right leg—the war wound acting up. “Kensington’s boys found Eddie’s body an hour ago. They know you ID’d him.”  </p>
<p>As if summoned, two shadows detached from a stack of crates stamped <em>Machine Parts</em>. The larger one swung a lead pipe. “Ain’t no room for nosey dames on the docks.”  </p>
<p>Viv’s switchblade snicked open. “Try the society pages, then.”  </p>
<p>The thug lunged. She ducked, slashing at his knees. The pipe grazed her shoulder—white-hot pain—before Rex’s Colt barked. The thug crumpled, clutching his thigh.  </p>
<p>“Christ, Viv!” Rex dragged her behind a forklift as bullets pinged off steel. “You’ve got nine lives and you’re on number eight!”  </p>
<p>She peered through the machinery. The second thug was shouting into a patrol box. “They’re calling reinforcements. We need—”  </p>
<p>A black Cadillac screeched into the yard. Mayor Kensington stepped out, immaculate in a dove-gray suit. “Miss Sinclair! Let’s discuss your… <em>ghostwriting</em>.”  </p>
<p>Rex cocked his revolver. “Stay behind me.”  </p>
<p>“Like hell.” Viv stood, back straight as a tombstone. “You murdered your own nephew, Harry.”  </p>
<p>Kensington’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Eddie lacked vision. You, however…” He nodded to his men. “Bring her. The throne prefers its sacrifices lively.”  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>The dock exploded into chaos. Rex tackled a guard into the Hudson, the man’s scream cut short by oily waves. Viv scrambled up a cargo net, lug wrench in hand. Above her, a crane swung a crate marked <em>Vatican Holdings</em>.  </p>
<p>“Catch!” Rex tossed her his revolver.  </p>
<p>She fired wild—shattering the crane’s control panel. Chains screeched. The crate plummeted, crushing Kensington’s sedan. The Mayor dove behind a pallet, linen suit smeared with fish guts. “You’ll drown in that dress, girl!”  </p>
<p>Saltwater soaked Viv’s skirt as she waded toward the riverwalk. A hand yanked her into a boathouse. Rex slammed the door, breathing ragged. “Key to the Lyric Theatre basement.” He pressed a tarnished brass key into her palm. “Underground tunnels connect to Kensington’s vault.”  </p>
<p>She stared at it. “Why help me?”  </p>
<p>“Because you’re the only one stubborn enough to bury that bastard.” He touched her bleeding shoulder—brief, paternal. “And I owe your father.”  </p>
<p>Footsteps pounded outside. Kensington’s voice boomed through the planks. “Come out, and I’ll make it quick!”  </p>
<p>Rex shoved her toward a rusted grate. “Sewer leads to Canal Street. Don’t look back.”  </p>
<p>“But—”  </p>
<p>He cocked his Colt with a grin. “I’ve survived worse.”  </p>
<p>The last thing Viv saw before the sewer swallowed her: Rex Donovan, framed in dawn light, singing <em>“When Johnny Comes Marching Home”</em> as the door burst open.  </p>
<p>Somewhere above, a single gunshot echoed.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Viv emerged in an alley behind the Fulton Fish Market, reeking of despair. The key bit her palm like a guilty secret. Around her, the city stirred—newsboys hawking headlines about Eddie’s “tragic accident,” trolleys rattling past shop windows displaying Kensington’s campaign posters.  </p>
<p>She ducked into a phone booth, dialing the Sentinel with a nickel slick from blood. “Fletcher? Run the obituary. Page six.”  </p>
<p>Static crackled. “Sinclair? Where the hell—”  </p>
<p>“Eddie Malone. He’s the Mayor’s nephew.” She watched a beat cop light a cigarette across the street. “And we’re going to print the truth.”  </p>
<p>The line went dead. Viv slid down the glass, knees pulled to chest. In her pocket, Eddie’s rosary tangled with the key—one to unlock ghosts, the other to bury them. Somewhere, a factory whistle screamed.  </p>
<p>CONTINUE  </p>
<p>The Sentinel’s presses roared like caged beasts. Fletcher slammed the morning edition onto Viv’s desk, ink still wet. <strong>MAYOR’S NEPHEW FOUND DEAD IN DOCK YARD TRAGEDY</strong> screamed the headline, her byline sharp beneath it.  </p>
<p>“You’ve got sand, Sinclair,” he growled, glass eye gleaming. “But sand don’t stop bullets.”  </p>
<p>She touched the bandage on her shoulder. “Any word on Rex?”  </p>
<p>“Donovan’s a cockroach. He’ll turn up.” Fletcher lit a cigar with shaking hands. “Kensington’s holding a press conference at noon. Wants to ‘address these vicious rumors.’”  </p>
<p>Viv stared at Eddie’s ring beside her typewriter. The lion crest leered. “Let me cover it.”  </p>
<p>“Like hell. You’re off the—”  </p>
<p>The window shattered.  </p>
<p>They hit the floor as bullets chewed the walls. Viv crawled under her desk, earring snagging on a splintered drawer. Fletcher’s cigar glowed in the dust. “East window! Fire escape!”  </p>
<p>She lunged for the emergency ladder, typewriter keys spraying like shrapnel. Three floors down, her knees buckled on the asphalt. The getaway car idled across the street—Vito Romano at the wheel, engine revving.  </p>
<p>“Need a ride, Red?”  </p>
<p>Tires screeched behind them. Viv dove into the Model A’s rumble seat as Vito floored it. “Who hates you more today? Kensington or God?”  </p>
<p>She clutched the Lyric Theatre key. “Take me to 48th &amp; Broadway.”  </p>
<p>He glanced in the rearview. “You’ll get us both killed.”  </p>
<p>“But what a way to go.”  </p>
<p>They vanished into midtown traffic, the Sentinel’s smoke staining the sky behind them. Somewhere, the throne waited—and with it, answers written in blood and emerald light.</p>
