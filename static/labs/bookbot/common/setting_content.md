**Setting Description for *Whispers in the Jazz*:**  

**Time Period & Historical Context:**  
Contemporary New Orleans, 2023. The city remains haunted by Hurricane Katrina’s scars—uneven recovery, gentrification tensions, and a lingering collective trauma. The French Quarter preserves its 18th-century architecture, but modern tech, rideshares, and boutique hotels collide with streetcar tracks and voodoo shops. Jazz funerals still wind through Tremé, and Mardi Gras beads dangle year-round from oak trees. October’s sticky heat hangs heavy, with Halloween decorations (skeletons, flickering jack-o’-lanterns) adorning wrought-iron galleries.  

---

**Key Locations:**  

**1. Rue Dumaine, French Quarter**  
- **Physical Description:** A cobblestone street 15 feet wide, cracked and gleaming after rain. Pastel townhouses (sun-faded pistachio, periwinkle, blush pink) press close, their wrought-iron balconies tangled with jasmine and bougainvillea. Streetlights cast amber pools on uneven sidewalks.  
- **Lila’s Apartment (3rd floor, 722 Rue Dumaine):**  
  - **Layout:** 800 sq ft, two original bedrooms converted into a music room (soundproofed, peeling damask wallpaper) and a cluttered living space. The galley kitchen smells of stale café au lait and roux. One bathroom with a clawfoot tub (chipped enamel) and a window overlooking a shared courtyard choked with banana plants.  
  - **Senses:**  
    - **Sight:** High ceilings with water stains, a 1920s Steinway grand piano (ebony, scratched legs), a flickering neon "Bourbon Street" sign salvaged from a defunct bar.  
    - **Sound:** Ceiling fans whirring, muffled jazz from Club Nuit Rouge three blocks away, the creak of floorboards.  
    - **Smell:** Jasmine from the courtyard, mildew under the sink, Lila’s vanilla perfume.  
    - **Touch:** Humid air clinging to skin, the piano’s ivory keys cool and slightly sticky.  
    - **Taste:** Dust, condensation from a sweating glass of sweet tea.  
- **Neighbors:** Mme. Leclerc (80s, widow in #720, feeds feral cats), Tyrell (street performer in #724, plays trumpet at dawn).  
- **Landmark:** A live oak at the corner of Dumaine and Chartres, its trunk carved with decades of initials.  

**2. Club Nuit Rouge, Bourbon Street**  
- **Physical Description:** A 19th-century Creole townhouse turned jazz club. Peeling scarlet door, black-marble bar lit by Tiffany lamps. The main room (40x60 ft) has a vaulted ceiling with exposed cypress beams. A stage framed by blood-red velvet curtains holds a baby grand piano (middle C key slightly flat). The back courtyard (30x30 ft) has a stone fountain filled with cigarette butts and a single koi fish.  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Gold fleur-de-lis wallpaper, smoke curling under emergency exit signs, the bartender’s dragon tattoo (coiling up his neck).  
  - **Sound:** Saxophone vibrato, ice clinking in bourbon glasses, a ceiling fan’s arrhythmic squeak.  
  - **Smell:** Spilled Sazerac, sweat, Chanel No. 5.  
  - **Touch:** Sticky tabletops, the piano bench’s cracked leather.  
  - **Taste:** Burn of cheap whiskey, salt from roasted pecans sold outside.  
- **Owner:** Marcel “Big Mac” Boudreaux (6’4”, scar across his throat from a bar fight).  

**3. Etienne’s Loft, Esplanade Avenue**  
- **Physical Description:** A converted 1920s warehouse near the Marigny border. Industrial steel door (code: 1892—the year his great-grandfather opened a photography studio). Open-concept 1,200 sq ft space: exposed brick, concrete floors stained with developer chemicals. A darkroom hides behind a sliding barn door (red lightbulb, smell of acetic acid).  
- **Bedroom:** Mattress on the floor, black linen tangled. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook a banyan tree strung with Mardi Gras beads.  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Police evidence photos pinned to a clothesline, a Leica camera disassembled on the kitchen island.  
  - **Sound:** Miles Davis on a vintage record player, the hum of a mini-fridge.  
  - **Smell:** Darkroom chemicals, espresso brewing, a hint of bergamot from his cologne.  
- **Landmark:** The Parisian La Croix Bakery across the street—6 AM croissant runs, butter scent wafting through his windows.  

**4. Bayou St. John Cottage**  
- **Physical Description:** A dilapidated shotgun house (1,000 sq ft) at 3023 Moss Street, 2 miles north of the Quarter. Overgrown garden (banana trees, wild ginger), a sagging porch with a swing. Inside: three rooms connected by a straight hallway. The front room has a collapsed sofa and a fireplace filled with Mardi Gras doubloons.  
- **Backroom:** A musician’s hideout—sheet music for unpublished jazz standards, a moth-eaten velvet loveseat, a 1950s Wurlitzer jukebox (broken, coin slot jammed with a hairpin).  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Greenish light through grimy windows, a Ouija board on the floor.  
  - **Sound:** Dripping faucet, cicadas, the groan of floor joists.  
  - **Smell:** Damp Sheetrock, magnolia blossoms, old bourbon.  
  - **Touch:** Splinters in the doorframe, the chill of a hidden crawlspace.  
- **Neighbor:** A retired tugboat captain who watches from his porch with binoculars.  

---

**Minor Locations:**  

- **Café Noir (Decatur Street):** Where Lila writes lyrics. Mint-green walls, lace curtains, mismatched china. The barista, Solène, knows everyone’s order. Smells of chicory coffee and powdered sugar from beignets.  
- **Jackson Square:** Street artists sketch tourists beside St. Louis Cathedral. A tarot reader (Madame Zarina) wears a gold tooth and warns Lila about “a man with two faces.”  
- **Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop (Bourbon Street):** Dim, candlelit bar where Etienne meets informants. The back room has a smuggler’s tunnel sealed since 1809.  

---

**Social & Cultural Context:**  
The jazz community is tight-knit, protective of its own. Old Creole families resent tech millionaires buying up shotgun houses. Police are distrusted; crime scenes become Instagram fodder. Voodoo isn’t magic here—just herbal shops and tourists buying gris-gris bags.  

**Atmosphere:**  
Sultry, seductive, claustrophobic. Thunderstorms erupt without warning. Neon reflects in rain puddles. Music is everywhere—brass bands, piano drift, the hum of a bass through open windows.

**5. Ninth Precinct Police Station, Tulane Avenue**  
- **Physical Description:** A Brutalist concrete box built in the 1970s, its façade stained with decades of exhaust and humidity. Flickering fluorescent lights in the lobby illuminate a cracked linoleum floor (spearmint green, scuffed to gray near the holding cells). The homicide division occupies the third floor—a maze of cubicles with outdated computers and evidence boards plastered with red string.

  - **Sight:** Flickering LED panels, a medical examiner’s tattoo (rosary around her wrist) as she stitches a Y-incision.  
  - **Sound:** The whirr of exhaust fans, a dripping faucet, the clink of surgical tools.

  - **Touch:** Cold metal against skin, latex gloves snapping.

- **Physical Description:** A crowd gathers at Zeller’s Funeral Home (sky-blue Victorian with peeling shutters). The hearse—a 1965 Cadillac draped in black velvet—is followed by a brass band playing “Just a Closer Walk With Thee.” The procession weaves through oak-shaded streets, mourners in white handkerchiefs and seersucker suits.  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Sunlight glinting off trombones, sweat-darkened shirt collars, a widow’s trembling hands.

  - **Touch:** Humidity thickening handkerchiefs, a stranger’s hand clasping Lila’s during “When the Saints Go Marching In.”  
  - **Taste:** Salt from tears, a shared flask of cinnamon whiskey.  
- **Cultural Note:** The deceased is a saxophonist; his band plays his final solo as they pass his favorite po’boy shop.  

**8. The Neon Moon Motel, St. Claude Avenue**  
- **Physical Description:** A 1950s motor court turned seedy hourly rental. Neon sign missing the “N” and “M,” flickering “Eo oo Motel.” Rooms face a cracked parking lot where a stray pitbull naps under a rusted pickup. Room #7 (where a victim’s credit card was last used) has bolt holes in the doorframe and a mattress stained with bleach.  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Peeling paisley wallpaper, a shattered TV screen, lipstick scrawl on a mirror: *HE WATCHES.*  
  - **Sound:** Bedsprings squeaking in adjacent rooms, a jukebox playing zydeco two blocks away.  
  - **Smell:** Mildew, cigarette ash, cloying air freshener (fake pine).  
  - **Touch:** Gritty bedsheets, a broken AC unit blowing tepid air.  
  - **Taste:** Sour regret, a $1 energy drink from the vending machine.  
- **Owner:** A chain-smoking desk clerk named Dwayne who records everything in a ledger labeled “CASH ONLY.”  

**9. Lila’s Childhood Home, Gentilly**  
- **Physical Description:** A post-Katrina rebuild—raised shotgun house with cobalt siding. The porch swing (where her father taught her piano chords) sags, chains rusted. Inside, her mother’s shrine to St. Jude dominates the living room: flickering tea lights, plastic roses, a photo of Lila’s drowned brother.  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Watermarks on the ceiling (pre-renovation), a Baldwin upright piano with yellowed keys.  
  - **Sound:** Tick of a metronome, ceiling fans fighting August heat.  
  - **Smell:** Simmering gumbo, Pledge lemon polish, attic mildew.  
  - **Touch:** Her mother’s bony hug, the piano bench’s split vinyl.

**10. The Riverfront Dock, Algiers Point**  
- **Physical Description:** Rotting wooden planks stretching into the Mississippi. A foggy dawn haunt for fishermen and smugglers. The *Belle of New Orleans* paddlewheeler glides past, tourists waving at egrets. Under the dock: a metal box hidden in algae-slick pilings (drugs, cash, a burner phone).  
- **Senses:**  
  - **Sight:** Barges glowing in predawn fog, a rat gnawing a crawfish carcass.  
  - **Sound:** Lapping waves, distant train horns, the creak of wood.

---  
**Expanded Social Context:**  
Gentrification fractures neighborhoods—tech bros in $800 Peloton shirts jog past homeless encampments under the Pontchartrain Expressway. The jazz community’s code of silence clashes with true crime podcasts exploiting unsolved murders. Voodoo priests double as TikTok influencers.  

**Atmosphere Additions:**  
Dawn mist rolls off the Mississippi, blurring crime scenes. Streetlights buzz like dying flies. Every kiss feels like a confession, every gunshot echoes through shotgun house hallways.

- **Physical Description:** A sprawling open-air market under a corrugated tin roof. Vendors hawk Creole tomatoes, alligator sausages, and handmade gris-gris bags.

- **Rumor:** A rapper filmed a music video here last year—crew swore they saw a ghostly girl on the carousel.  

---  
**Expanded Social Context:**  
- **Crime & Corruption:** Cops skim bribes from Bourbon Street bars but turn blind eyes to Uptown country club coke rings. A DA candidate’s “clean up the Quarter” ads play during true crime podcasts.  
- **Family Dynamics:** Creole matriarchs wield cast-iron skillets and generational grudges. A cousin’s success as a TikTok chef sparks silent envy at Sunday suppers.  
- **Romantic Entanglements:** Affairs begin at jazz funerals and end at the Neon Moon Motel. Love is a currency; secrets are collateral.  

**Atmosphere Final Touches:**  
- **Lighting:** Neon fractures in rain puddles, creating kaleidoscopes of lies. Midnight is both witching hour and confession time.  
- **Soundtrack:** A street musician’s trumpet echoes a victim’s last scream. The hum of the Quarter is a metronome for murder.
