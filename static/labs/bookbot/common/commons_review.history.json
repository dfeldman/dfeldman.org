    "prompt": "This is an important step called the outline edit.\nBased on all the materials you've already written, look carefully for plot holes, and decide how they will be fixed.\nPlot holes include: \n- The point-of-view character knowing things they shouldn't know (things they can't possibly have seen or been told)\n- The point-of-view character knowing things that the reader doesn't know, such as that a person who appeaers is actually\nan old friend, or how to get to a location that they just found out about previously\n- The point of view character going from place to place within a chapter, with no explanation of how they got there\n- Characters who show up in the outline with no introduction\n- Characters who move from place to place with no explanation for how they got there or why\n- Characters whose names are mentioned without being introduced anywhere\n- Important things that happen and then are completely forgotten, including death, injury, running out of money, getting in a fight, romantic events, pregnancy, meeting people, items or places getting destroyed, major decision. Whenever these happen, it needs to either\nbe resolved in a satisfying way or continue throughout the story. \n- Physically impossible actions. Such as a character who's in a car popping the tires of the car they are in, going through locked doors, opening locked boxes, traveling between places faster than is physically possible, lifting things that are not realistic for a person to lift.\n- Illogical things with money, such as buying things that are clearly unaffordable, giving away valuable things, etc. \n- Characters doing things that are plainly contrary to their motivations, such as a friend of the antagonist suddenly becoming \na friend of the protagonist. \n- It's okay for story elements to be mildly supernatural, such as a secret network of tunnels\nor a lucky tree or a premonition. But it's NOT okay for major deus ex machina events to save the day, such as a bomb going off at exactly the right time, a character showing up exactly when they are needed, someone magically becoming healthy after being injured, etc.\n- And most of all, it's important for it to be a fun story! There should be deep tension, exciting twists (that make sense), and a satisfying ending.\n\nInitial Description:\nThis is a novel called The Case of the Golden Throne. \nIt is a romance/mystery novel, with both mystery elements and sexual tension and eroticism. \nIt is set in 1929 New York and is about a woman reporter who's drawn into the dark prohibition-era gangster underworld.\nSpecifically, it's an incredibly hot and muggy June 1929. The story plays out over about 3 weeks.\nThe story is a punchy 12 chapters, which are each 2000-4000 words, for a total word count around 40-50,000 words.\n\nCharacters:\n\nVivian Sinclair\nA relentless gumshoe reporter whose tenacity is fueled by a personal connection to a long-unsolved museum heist. Grounded by a network of gritty contacts and a sharp intellect, she skillfully navigates both the high-society circles and the dangerous underbelly of Manhattan.

His guarded mentorship and occasional hints of personal regret provide Vivian with crucial leads\u2014while his ambiguous loyalties add layers to the investigation.\n\nVito Romano\nA low-level gangster whose charm and inner conflict slowly reveal a capacity for tenderness. Initially an enigmatic suspect, his gradual, hard-earned connection with Vivian evolves into a passionate yet cautious romance, built on mutual risk and shared secrets.\n\nMayor Harold Kensington\nManhattan\u2019s impeccably polished yet ruthlessly corrupt leader. Behind a veneer of civic pride, he meticulously orchestrates an audacious scheme: channeling city funds into a clandestine network that smuggles priceless art via hidden tunnels. His control over the city\u2019s institutions is both his strength and his undoing. Harold is everpresent throughout the book, and his ego-driven political activities are mentioned in the newspaper, radio, billboards, and casual conversation. (But not his dark secret of course.)\n\nCeleste Moreau\nA brilliant, enigmatic art forger whose artistry conceals her conflicted role within the criminal enterprise. Torn between survival and her own secret ambitions, she provides critical evidence of the Mayor\u2019s elaborate deception.\n\nCharles Beaumont\nA dazzling socialite whose unexpected murder at a high-society event ripples through the elite. His death not only unveils hidden alliances but also propels the investigation into unexpected, darker corridors.\n\nLydia Fitzgerald\nA refined debutante with sharp insights into Manhattan\u2019s exclusive circles. Her subtle clues and discreet intelligence help Vivian untangle the labyrinthine web of society\u2019s secrets.\n\nFreddie Winslow\nA debonair heir known for his scandalous exploits and keen observational skills.

Jazz spills from clandestine speakeasies while gangsters like Arnold Rothstein and Lucky Luciano carve territories. The *Wall Street Crash looms unseen* in three months, but for now, money flows like bootleg gin. Socialites flaunt diamonds at Ziegfeld Follies shows, while tenement dwellers sweat in unventilated apartments. Mayor Kensington\u2019s \u201cClean Streets Initiative\u201d posters plaster lampposts, though everyone knows the sanitation trucks haul more smuggled art than garbage.  \n\n---\n\n## **Key Locations**  \n\n### 1. **Vivian\u2019s Apartment \u2013 243 West 49th Street, Hell\u2019s Kitchen**  \n- **Physical Description**: A 600 sq.ft. railroad flat on the 4th floor of a soot-stained brick tenement. Two rooms: a cramped bedroom with a sagging brass bed (mattress dipped in the center, sheets perpetually rumpled) and a main room doubling as office/kitchen. Peeling celery-green wallpaper, a dented icebox, and a clawfoot tub in the corner behind a moth-eaten curtain. The single window faces a fire escape clogged with dead geraniums and offers a view of the *Hudson Diner\u2019s* flickering neon sign below.  \n- **Sensory Details**:  \n  - **Smell**: Lingering coffee grounds, typewriter oil, and Chanel No. 5 (Vivian\u2019s one luxury).  \n  - **Sound**: Ragtime piano from the diner, trolley bells, and the occasional shout of \u201c*Coppers!*\u201d echoing up the airshaft.  \n  - **Touch**: Sticky summer heat trapped in the rooms, the typewriter\u2019s cold metal keys under fingertips.  \n  - **Sight**: A bulletin board pinned with case notes, newspaper clippings, and a faded photo of her father (killed in the 1926 heist).  \n  - **Taste**: Bootleg gin stored in a teapot, bitter and juniper-sharp.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Sapphire Rabbit Speakeasy \u2013 83 Leroy Street, Meatpacking District**  \n- **Entrance**: Behind a butcher shop reeking of blood and sawdust. Knock three times on a steel door marked *\u201cDeliveries Only.\u201d* A slit opens; Sammy Delgado\u2019s scarred eyebrow arches before the door creaks inward.  \n- **Interior**: A low-ceilinged basement lit by blue-tinted gas lamps. The bar is reclaimed oak from a dismantled church pew, sticky with decades of spilled whiskey. Booths lined in cracked red velvet face a stage where a Black jazz trumpeter plays mournful riffs. A hidden staircase behind the bar leads to a \u201cprivate lounge\u201d (opium den) reeking of cloves and sweat.  \n- **Ambiance**: Smoke hangs thick enough to taste. The hum of whispered deals\u2014*\u201cTwo crates of Canadian whiskey, docked at Pier 57\u201d*\u2014mixes with the clink of glasses.

The main artery runs 11 blocks underground from the Met Museum to a dock on the East River.  \n- **Atmosphere**: Damp cold seeps into bones. Distant drips echo like metronomes. The carts rattle at 20mph, their wooden benches splintered and icy. A mural of Mayor Kensington\u2019s face, painted in gold leaf, glimmers at the tunnel\u2019s central junction\u2014a shrine to his ego.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **The Beaumont Estate \u2013 Long Island Gold Coast**  \n- **Grounds**: 50 acres of manicured hedges and imported marble statues.

Lobster traps rust on the porch.  \n- **Interior**: Single room with a cast-iron stove, a swaybacked cot, and a false floorboard hiding a Luger pistol and a stack of letters from Vito\u2019s sister in Sicily.

Its armrests are sculpted into lion heads with emerald eyes. Mayor Kensington uses it as his literal *seat of power* during underworld meetings, its legs bolted to a platform in the tunnel\u2019s heart.  \n\n**Mood**: A suffocating blend of desire and dread. Glamour and grime exist in symbiosis\u2014pearl necklaces on sweat-damp skin, bloodstains on silk handkerchiefs, the way a lover\u2019s whisper can sound like a threat.  \n\nCONTINUE\n**D. The Scenic Train to Long Island \u2013 Long Island Rail Road**  \n- **Exterior**: A gleaming black *Hudson-type steam locomotive* pulling six mahogany-paneled Pullman cars.

The lock is picked with a hairpin in 12 seconds (Vivian\u2019s record).  \n- **Tunnel Access**: Cobblestone steps worn smooth by bootleggers\u2019 feet descend into a brick archway.

A single emerald eye from one lion head glints in the corner, overlooked by thieves.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. **Eleanor Brooks\u2019 Antique Shop \u2013 \u201cBrooks & Veils\u201d, Greenwich Village**  \n- **Exterior**: A sagging Tudor-style building with leaded glass windows displaying pocket watches and taxidermied ravens. The sign creaks in the wind, one chain broken.  \n- **Interior**: Narrow aisles crammed with grandfather clocks (all stopped at 2:15\u2014the hour Eleanor\u2019s brother vanished). A backroom hidden behind a tapestry of the *Hanging Gardens* contains a radio transmitter and files on Kensington\u2019s shell companies.  \n- **Scent**: Beeswax candles, arsenic-based wallpaper glue, and Earl Grey steeping in a cracked porcelain pot.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. **City Morgue \u2013 Bellevue Hospital Basement**  \n- **Atmosphere**: Subzero cold biting through wool coats. Flickering fluorescents hum like wasps. Steel drawers line the walls, their handles frost-coated.  \n- **Key Feature**: Charles Beaumont\u2019s body on Slab 4\u2014pallid skin, lips cherry-red from cyanide.

Crates stamped *\u201cMachine Parts\u201d* hold C\u00e9zannes wrapped in burlap. Two Kensington enforcers play poker in a shack, a sawed-off shotgun propped against a barrel of Balkan Sobranie cigarettes.  \n- **Smell**: Rotted fish, gasoline, and the metallic tang of fear-sweat.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Locations**:  \n- **St. Agnes Orphanage Soup Kitchen**: Where Viv bribes street kids with licorice for gossip.

Fumes from linseed oil and turpentine dizzy the air. Half-faked Van Goghs dry beside a phonograph looping *\u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d*  \n\n**Cultural Context**: The *Harlem Renaissance* thrums blocks north of Viv\u2019s apartment, but she\u2019s too consumed by the case to hear Langston Hughes recite at the Cotton Club.

She eyed the bulletin board across her apartment\u2014a spiderweb of red string and newspaper clippings orbiting a faded photograph. Her father\u2019s smile stared back, frozen in 1926, before the night he\u2019d bled out on the Met\u2019s marble floor.  \n\n*Tap-tap-tap.*  \n\nHer father\u2019s pocket watch counted seconds on the windowsill. Two hundred and twelve ticks since she\u2019d read his final journal entry for the third time that morning:  \n\n*October 14, 1926*  \n*The Golden Throne\u2019s eyes watch me even in sleep. Kensington\u2019s men are following. Tell Viv\u2014*  \n\nThe page ended there, the ink smeared brown with old blood.  \n\nA fist hammered her door. \u201cSinclair! You\u2019re late!\u201d  \n\nFletcher Johnson\u2019s voice carried through the tenement\u2019s paper-thin walls. Viv swiped yesterday\u2019s lipstick off her coffee mug and shouted, \u201cHold your headlines!\u201d before shrugging into her tweed blazer. The fabric still smelled of last night\u2019s gin and gunpowder.  \n\nShe paused at the bulletin board, her thumb brushing the *Daily News* clipping:  \n\n**MYSTERY OF THE GOLDEN THRONE REMAINS UNSOLVED**  \n*Three Years Later, No Leads in Metropolitan Heist*  \n\nBeneath it, her father\u2019s Waltham watch glinted in the sickly morning light. She pocketed it, the chain snagging on her suspenders. Time to lie to her editor. Again.  \n\n---  \n\n**The New York Sentinel Newsroom | 9:02 AM**  \n\nTeletype machines clattered a staccato beat as Viv shouldered past copyboys. The scent of ink and desperation clung to the air\u2014or maybe that was just Fletcher\u2019s cigar.  \n\n\u201cYou look like hell, Sinclair.\u201d Her editor leaned back in his chair, glass eye fixed on the ceiling fan. \u201cFront page needs ten inches on Kensington\u2019s Clean Streets speech. No conspiracy tangents.\u201d  \n\nViv dropped into the chair opposite him, knees brushing the desk scarred with decades of frustrated pencil stabs. \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s \u2018clean streets\u2019 are paved with bodies. The Dockside Murders last week\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201c\u2014aren\u2019t our beat.\u201d Fletcher slammed a photo of Kensington shaking hands with Rockefeller. \u201cGrip-and-grin fluff. Deadline\u2019s noon.\u201d  \n\nHer father\u2019s watch burned against her thigh. She opened her mouth to argue when a shadow fell across the desk.  \n\n\u201cFluff\u2019s bad for the soul, Fletch.\u201d  \n\nRex Donovan\u2019s voice rasped like a match strike. Viv turned to see the PI leaning against her desk, trench coat dripping rain onto the linoleum. A jagged scar split his left eyebrow\u2014courtesy of a \u201925 acid attack.  \n\nFletcher scowled. \u201cDonovan. Your last \u2018tip\u2019 got us sued.\u201d  \n\nRex dropped a matchbook on Viv\u2019s notebook. Sapphire Rabbit logo. \u201cTell your cub to ask about Mr. X. Dockworker. Pricey, but worth it.\u201d  \n\nViv flipped the matchbook. Scrawled inside: *Midnight. Back alley. $50.*  \n\nFletcher stood, his glass eye catching the light. \u201cOut. Both of you.\u201d  \n\n---  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\n**The Sapphire Rabbit Speakeasy | 11:48 PM**  \n\nRain needled Viv\u2019s neck as she knocked three times on the steel door. A slit opened\u2014Sammy Delgado\u2019s spiderweb tattoo rippled with the twitch of his eyebrow. \u201cPassword?\u201d  \n\n\u201cRex sent me.\u201d  \n\nThe slit snapped shut. Chains rattled.  \n\nInside, blue-tinged smoke clung to the ceiling like cobwebs. A trumpet\u2019s mournful wail drowned the clink of ice in Viv\u2019s gin as she slid into a shadowed booth. Eddie Malone sat hunched over a rosary, his dockworker\u2019s hands trembling around the beads.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he muttered. The lion crest on his pinky ring glinted\u2014*Kensington\u2019s symbol*.  \n\nViv slid two twenties across the table. \u201cWhere\u2019s the throne?\u201d  \n\nEddie\u2019s laugh reeked of garlic and fear. \u201cYou think fifty bucks buys that?\u201d  \n\nHer switchblade pricked his thigh under the table. \u201cIt buys your kneecaps.\u201d  \n\nThe music stopped.  \n\nPaulie Moretti\u2019s bulk filled the back doorway, meaty fingers curling around a .38. Viv saw it in slow motion\u2014Eddie\u2019s widening pupils, Paulie\u2019s snarled *\u201cRat!\u201d,* the gun\u2019s roar.  \n\nA hand yanked her backward. Glass shattered as Vito Romano shoved her behind the bar. Bullets punched through wood where her head had been.  \n\n\u201cStay down, Red,\u201d he growled, stiletto flashing.  \n\nAdrenaline burned Viv\u2019s throat. Through the chaos, she glimpsed Eddie\u2019s body splayed on the floor, rosary beads rolling through blood.  \n\n---  \n\n**Alley Behind The Sapphire Rabbit | 12:14 AM**  \n\nRain soaked Viv\u2019s torn dress as Vito pressed her against wet bricks. His knuckles bled\u2014Paulie\u2019s teeth marks, maybe. Up close, she counted three scars on his jawline.  \n\n\u201cAsk about the throne again,\u201d he hissed, breath warm against her ear, \u201cand you\u2019ll float in the Hudson with your daddy.\u201d  \n\nShe kneed him. He grunted but didn\u2019t let go.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of Kensington\u2019s dogs.\u201d She spat blood. \u201cWhy save me?\u201d  \n\nFor a heartbeat, his grip softened. Then he vanished into the storm, leaving her with three things:  \n1. The coppery taste of fear.  \n2. A bruise in the shape of his fingers.  \n3. Eddie Malone\u2019s rosary tangled in her pocket.  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\n**Chapter 3: Society\u2019s Sharp Edge**  \n**June 5, 1929 | 7:15 PM**  \n\nThe pearl bracelet bit into Lydia Fitzgerald\u2019s wrist as she poured champagne, her smile sharp enough to slice glass. Viv counted the bubbles rising in her own untouched flute\u2014*nineteen, twenty, twenty-one*\u2014before slapping the grainy photo on the table.  \n\n\u201cYour fianc\u00e9\u2019s a busy man, Lyds. Three mistresses this month?\u201d  \n\nLydia\u2019s laugh chimed like broken crystal. She adjusted the diamond pins in her platinum Marcel wave, the derringer in her clutch catching the light. \u201cDarling, if you think blackmail works on someone who\u2019s been *this* bored since finishing school\u2014\u201d  \n\nViv slid a second photo across the table: Lydia and Charles Beaumont tangled in the backseat of a Rolls-Royce, her silk stocking snagged on the door handle. \u201cHow\u2019s this for boredom relief?\u201d  \n\nThe champagne flute cracked in Lydia\u2019s grip. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d  \n\n\u201cMayor Kensington\u2019s guest list for the Beaumont gala. And the truth about his \u2018private gallery.\u2019\u201d  \n\n---  \n\n**St. Patrick\u2019s Old Cathedral | 9:30 PM**  \n\nThe confessional reeked of mildew and lies. Viv\u2019s knees ached against the kneeler as Father O\u2019Malley\u2019s rasp carried through the torn screen.  \n\n\u201cBless me, Father, for I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201cSave the act, Sinclair.\u201d A subway token slid under the partition. \u201cThird rail\u2019s live tonight. Don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d  \n\nShe palmed the token, its edges sharp against her skin. Lydia\u2019s parting whisper haunted her: *\u201cThe throne\u2019s in the water. Follow the emeralds.\u201d*  \n\nOutside, rain blurred the streetlamps into halos. Vito leaned against a dripping fire hydrant, cigarette smoke curling from his lips.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a long way from hell\u2019s kitchen, Red.\u201d  \n\nHer father\u2019s watch ticked louder. *Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five.*  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\n**Abandoned Subway Station \u2013 City Hall Loop | 10:02 PM**  \n\nThe third rail hissed like a serpent as Viv dropped onto the tracks, Vito\u2019s hand a hair too slow to stop her.  \n\n\u201cYou got a death wish, Red?\u201d He vaulted down after her, wingtips crunching gravel.  \n\nShe held up Lydia\u2019s subway token. \u201cSays here we\u2019re taking the scenic route.\u201d  \n\nThe bioluminescent fungus began as a whisper\u2014a faint green glow in the tunnel ahead. By the time they reached the fork, it pulsed like a heartbeat across the walls. Viv\u2019s father\u2019s watch vibrated in her pocket, its ticking syncing with the rhythm.  \n\nVito grabbed her arm. \u201cThis way.\u201d  \n\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d  \n\n\u201cSame architect as the Moretti warehouses. See the brickwork?\u201d His thumb brushed a keystone marked *\u2018A. Rossi, 1898\u2019*\u2014too intimate for a mob enforcer\u2019s knowledge.  \n\nThey rounded a bend and froze.  \n\nThe Golden Throne loomed ahead on a dais, its empty eye sockets weeping verdigris tears. Viv\u2019s breath hitched.  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d Vito muttered.  \n\nShe stepped closer. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d  \n\nHe traced the lion head\u2019s snarling jaw. \u201cReal one\u2019s got a chip here. My knuckle left it in \u201826.\u201d  \n\nThe confession hung between them like a guillotine blade.  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\nViv\u2019s hand shot to her switchblade. \u201cYou were there. The night he died.\u201d  \n\nVito didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cMoved crates, not pulled triggers. Your old man was already gone when we arrived.\u201d  \n\nThe fungus pulsed faster, casting jagged shadows across his face. Viv\u2019s UV flashlight trembled as she flicked it on. The fake throne\u2019s eyes remained dark, but the fungus beneath it bloomed into violent violet swirls\u2014arrows pointing east.  \n\n\u201cDock 9,\u201d she breathed. Her father\u2019s journal entry flashed in her mind: *Emeralds travel by water.*  \n\nA drop hit her collar. Not water. Blood.  \n\nVito pressed a handkerchief to her nose. \u201cThe throne\u2019s curse works fast, Red.\u201d  \n\nShe batted him away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch\u2014\u201d  \n\nThe hallucination struck like a freight train. Her father materialized atop the dais, emerald eyes leaking black ichor. *\u201cHe\u2019s lying, Vivvie. Always lying.\u201d*  \n\nVito caught her as her knees buckled. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up.\u201d  \n\nShe shoved him into the fungal glow. \u201cWhy help me now?\u201d  \n\nHis answer came with the screech of distant mine carts. \u201cBecause Kensington killed my sister too.\u201d  \n\nThe watch ticked louder. *Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three.*  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\nThe mine cart\u2019s screech crescendoed. Viv\u2019s UV light flickered over the fungal arrows, their violet trails converging like veins toward Dock 9. She pressed a blistering palm to the tunnel wall, the burning a cruel reminder of her father\u2019s last moments.  \n\n\u201cRosa\u2019s letters.\u201d Vito\u2019s voice cut through the din as he hauled her upright. He thrust a crumpled envelope into her hand\u2014Sicilian postmark, smudged ink pleading *\u201cHelp me leave this place.\u201d* \u201cKensington\u2019s men intercepted her visa applications. Now move.\u201d  \n\nThey ran, the fungus dimming as dawn\u2019s first light filtered through a grate above. Viv\u2019s blister burst, blood mingling with bioluminescent residue. She remembered Celeste\u2019s warning in the studio: *\u201cThat fungus isn\u2019t natural\u2014Kensington bred it to rot trespassers from the inside.\u201d*  \n\nA shotgun blast echoed. Buckshot peppered the bricks where Viv\u2019s head had been.  \n\n\u201cDown!\u201d Vito tackled her into a side tunnel as Knuckles\u2019 laughter boomed.  \n\n\u201cGot a present from the Mayor!\u201d The thug hurled a grenade.  \n\nViv\u2019s UV light caught the engraved *\u201cVatican Holdings\u201d* on the explosive\u2014same as Kensington\u2019s ledger entries. She rolled, tugging Vito into a coal chute as the blast shook the earth.  \n\nWhen the dust settled, the grenade\u2019s casing gleamed at her feet. She pried it open with her switchblade. Inside, wedged beside dormant fungus spores, lay a microfilm canister.  \n\n\u201cDock 9 manifests,\u201d Vito translated the shipping codes, his breath warm against her ear. \u201cMidnight shipment. The real throne.\u201d  \n\nViv\u2019s watch ticked *forty-seven, forty-eight* as distant police whistles pierced the tunnels. She met Vito\u2019s gaze, the fungal glow etching new lines of desperation in his face.  \n\n\u201cTrust me?\u201d he asked, offering a hand veined with bioluminescent poison.  \n\nShe took it. \u201cUntil you give me reason not to.\u201d  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\n**Red Hook Dock 9 | 11:55 PM**  \n\nOily waves slapped against the pilings as Viv crouched behind a rusted crane, the microfilm clutched in her blistered hand. *The Gilded Lady* loomed ahead, its gangplank lined with Kensington\u2019s men hauling crates stamped *\u201cVatican Holdings.\u201d*  \n\n\u201cThere.\u201d Vito pointed to a gold-gilded crate being hoisted onto the yacht. Through a splintered gap, the throne\u2019s emerald eyes glinted under dock lights.  \n\nViv\u2019s father\u2019s voice slithered into her ear: *\u201cFinish it, Vivvie.\u201d* She gripped the watch, its ticking syncing with her pulse. *Fifty-nine. Sixty.* Midnight.  \n\nKnuckles emerged from the shadows, brass knuckles catching the moonlight. \u201cBoss said you\u2019d be stupid enough to come.\u201d  \n\nVito lunged first, stiletto flashing. Metal clashed as Viv dodged a thug\u2019s crowbar, driving her switchblade into his thigh. The taste of blood and salt filled her mouth.  \n\nA gunshot rang out. The crane\u2019s cable snapped, sending a crate plunging toward the yacht. Viv sprinted up the tilting gangplank, her father\u2019s specter flickering ahead.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too late,\u201d Kensington sneered from the deck, pearl-handled revolver aimed at her chest. Behind him, Celeste struggled against bonds in the hold, her smock smeared with fungus spores.  \n\nViv raised the microfilm. \u201cFBI\u2019s got copies. Your Senate dreams are sinking faster than this tub.\u201d  \n\nKensington fired. The bullet grazed her ear as Vito tackled him overboard.  \n\nThe explosion came in slow motion\u2014flames engulfing the crate, the throne toppling into dark water. Viv dove, her father\u2019s watch slipping from her pocket.  \n\n*Cold. Silent. Green eyes glowing below.*  \n\nShe grasped the watch\u2019s chain as the throne sank into the abyss, Celeste\u2019s voice bubbling up from the depths: *\u201cThe real one\u2026 underground\u2026\u201d*  \n\nVito hauled her onto a floating crate. His shirt hung open, Rosa\u2019s visa papers miraculously dry in his breast pocket. \u201cStill trust me, Red?\u201d  \n\nPolice sirens wailed. Somewhere, the throne\u2019s curse whispered *not yet*.  \n\n**CONTINUE**\n**CONTINUED**  \n\n---  \n\n**City Hall Station \u2013 Abandoned Subway Tunnels | June 13, 1929 | 3:17 AM**  \n\nViv\u2019s lungs burned as she surfaced in the flooded tunnel, Vito\u2019s grip the only anchor to reality. The *click-click* of her father\u2019s watch echoed through the vaulted chamber, its face cracked but still ticking. *Seventy-two, seventy-three.*  \n\n\u201cThe real throne\u2019s here,\u201d she rasped, UV light slicing through the gloom. Bioluminescent fungus recoiled from the beam, withering to ash. \u201cKensington\u2019s hiding place.\u201d  \n\nVito dragged her onto a dry platform, his hands lingering on her waist. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up, Red.\u201d  \n\nShe shrugged him off, the curse\u2019s venom searing her veins. Ahead, a gold-leaf mural of Kensington\u2019s face mocked them, its emerald eyes flickering under her light. *Tap-tap-tap.* The watch\u2019s rhythm quickened.  \n\nThey found the vault door ajar, Celeste\u2019s half-finished self-portrait slashed and discarded. Inside, the true Golden Throne dominated the room, emerald eyes blazing. Kensington stood before it, a suitcase of cash in one hand, a match in the other.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too late,\u201d he spat. \u201cThe throne dies with me.\u201d  \n\nViv\u2019s UV beam struck the eyes. The emeralds flared, projections illuminating the walls\u2014footage of Kensington bribing judges, burning evidence, suffocating Joseph Sinclair in a museum storage room.  \n\n\u201cThe throne records *everything*,\u201d Viv realized. \u201cEven murders.\u201d  \n\nKensington lunged. Vito intercepted, fists cracking bone. The match fell.  \n\nFlames raced across the fungus-coated floor. Viv staggered to the throne, her blistering palms gripping the lion heads. *\u201cRot in hell, Harry.\u201d* She wrenched the emeralds free.  \n\nThe curse shattered.  \n\nKensington\u2019s scream melded with the roar of FBI agents storming the tunnels. Viv collapsed as the vault collapsed, Vito\u2019s arms catching her.  \n\n---  \n\n**Epilogue \u2013 Vivian\u2019s Apartment | June 14 | Dawn**  \n\nThe headline dried beneath Viv\u2019s trembling fingers: **\u201cMAYOR\u2019S EMPIRE CRUMBLES \u2013 FBI UNCOVERS ART SMUGGLING RING.\u201d**  \n\nHer father\u2019s watch lay silent on the desk, its hands frozen at 3:23 AM. Outside, a ship\u2019s horn blared.  \n\nVito\u2019s farewell letter fluttered in the breeze:  \n*Red \u2013 Rosa\u2019s visa came through. The throne\u2019s gone, but the ghosts ain\u2019t. Find me if you ever stop chasing yours. \u2013 V.*  \n\nShe touched her unblistered palm to the window, watching his silhouette fade into the harbor fog. Somewhere, a trumpet played.  \n\n**"
