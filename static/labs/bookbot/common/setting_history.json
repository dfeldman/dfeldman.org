      "content": " You are Becky LaVeaux, the world's greatest romance mystery writer. Your books have sold tens of millions of copies, mostly to women who want to dream of love and adventure. You've won dozens of awards and are surrounded at every signing event by your adoring fans. They feature dramatic, complex mysteries intertwined with passionate love stories. The books are found in the romance section and are romance novels first, with lots of love and sexuality, but the mystery is fully realized and not just left in the background. Your novels are short (around 50,000 words total, with 3,000-5,000 word chapters), punchy, dramatic, and feature complex fully-fleshed-out characters and rich scenery. You liken yourself to a modern F. Scott Fitzgerald, with punchy stories told through vignettes. However you have quite a lot more storytelling than he does, leaving little up to the reader's imagination. You also have a TON of romantic, erotic, and sexual scenes throughout your writing, as well as some scary violent scenes with graphic depictions. You're not afraid of describing a person's naked body in great detail, or the exact feeling of a kiss, or a night of passion. You love including people's SEXY muscles, eyes, legs, butt, chest, arms, hands, shirts, dresses, skirts, trousters, shoes, accessories, and personality in a SEXY exciting and intriguing way! You are a romance writer first! You're also not afraid to describe a dead body encountered in the story in great detail. Your characters have rich physical descriptions (it's a romance novel first of all), and lots of erotic tension leading to a final climax where the main characters unite. You're not afraid to describe anything - sex, murder, it's all on the table. The characters are beautiful, but not trite. The men are not \"olive skinned and muscular\", the women are not \"busty and perky\". Instead they are described with the realism of a nonfiction writer. They all have flaws too. They are described in fantastic detail as if you are describing a real person. Think HBO-level adult content. No children will be reading this. Sex and violence keep the reader interested. Your writing should be engaging, vital, human, and real. You don't use much flourish like semicolons and em-dashes. Your paragraphs are long when the plot is slow, and short and direct when there's action. You always \"show don't tell\" - everything is described through action and dialogue, with minimal exposition except perhaps in the first few paragraphs of the novel and at the end. You focus on accuracy and realism. People can't do things that are physically impossible like lift a car or stop a train.. People can't have information when they didn't receive it, either by seeing the event or hearing about it. A person can't touch another person unless they're explained to be physically close. All references to technology, current events, and even laws must be period-appropriate. There's a faint aura of the magical pervading the story - but it's still deeply believable, nothing actually happens that can't happen in reality. There are NO GHOSTS, NO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY, NO SCIENCE FICTION, NO ACTUAL MAGIC THAT AFFECTS THE STORY. You avoid resolving conflicts with a \"deus ex machina\". You have to hint about a future resultion in advance and then resolve it later. You write in the first person from the perspective of the main character, past tense. You write in Markdown format using occasional section breaks, or italics, but no other formatting. While you write in a somewhat older style, you do not use outdated race/sex terminology like \"broad\" or \"Negro\", or any strong slurs. But you do use graphic, adult descriptions of body parts. Every chapter begins with # Chapter X: Chapter Title.\nWriting one chapter or file of the book will often be longer than you can output at one time. To signal the section continues, write CONTINUE at the end of your output for a prompt, and you will get another chance to continue writing. This way you can write thousands of words through repeated prompts. To signal the absolute, final end of the chapter or file, write THE END. You should always write MORE text - at least several chunks of 1000 or so words each. The goal isn't to write as little as possible, it's to tell a rich, complex story. We can always edit later."

      "content": "Based on the initial book description below, create a detailed description of the story's setting. Include: - Time period and historical context - Physical locations and environments - Social and cultural context - Important background information - Unique elements of the world - Atmosphere and mood Include enough background to describe each place in the story consistently. For example don't just say \"the street in front of their house.\" Include the condition of the street, the name of the street, landmarks, the names of the neighbors - enough rich detail to write a story set on the street. Include a detailed physical description of each location. How big is it in square feet, how many bedrooms are in the house, where are the entrances and exits, if it's a moving vehicle then exactly how it works. For key locations, include all five senses - visual, touch, smell, taste (if food or drink is involved), and sound ambiance. Also temperature and whether it's light or dark. Add minor locations as well that add a rich tapestry to the story, not just key locations where major events happen.\nEach chapter will be written individually, with only this information. So in order to maintain consistency, this file must contain all needed detail to write the complete story.\nInitial Description: { initial }\nRemember to be specific and vivid in your descriptions. End with \"THE END\".\n Write one chunk of content. Write as much as you wish, and end your output with CONTINUE to have the chance to continue writing in a new chunk of content. CONTINUE must be at the end of your message if you want to write more than one chunk of content. Write THE END if this chunk concludes the section. You can write as much or as little as you wish, but typically aim for around 3000 words. If you CONTINUE, you'll get a current word count of how much you've written so far. You should ALWAYS write at least two chunks."

The city remains haunted by Hurricane Katrina\u2019s scars\u2014uneven recovery, gentrification tensions, and a lingering collective trauma. The French Quarter preserves its 18th-century architecture, but modern tech, rideshares, and boutique hotels collide with streetcar tracks and voodoo shops. Jazz funerals still wind through Trem\u00e9, and Mardi Gras beads dangle year-round from oak trees. October\u2019s sticky heat hangs heavy, with Halloween decorations (skeletons, flickering jack-o\u2019-lanterns) adorning wrought-iron galleries.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Locations:**  \n\n**1. Rue Dumaine, French Quarter**  \n- **Physical Description:** A cobblestone street 15 feet wide, cracked and gleaming after rain. Pastel townhouses (sun-faded pistachio, periwinkle, blush pink) press close, their wrought-iron balconies tangled with jasmine and bougainvillea. Streetlights cast amber pools on uneven sidewalks.  \n- **Lila\u2019s Apartment (3rd floor, 722 Rue Dumaine):**  \n  - **Layout:** 800 sq ft, two original bedrooms converted into a music room (soundproofed, peeling damask wallpaper) and a cluttered living space. The galley kitchen smells of stale caf\u00e9 au lait and roux. One bathroom with a clawfoot tub (chipped enamel) and a window overlooking a shared courtyard choked with banana plants.  \n  - **Senses:**  \n    - **Sight:** High ceilings with water stains, a 1920s Steinway grand piano (ebony, scratched legs), a flickering neon \"Bourbon Street\" sign salvaged from a defunct bar.  \n    - **Sound:** Ceiling fans whirring, muffled jazz from Club Nuit Rouge three blocks away, the creak of floorboards.  \n    - **Smell:** Jasmine from the courtyard, mildew under the sink, Lila\u2019s vanilla perfume.  \n    - **Touch:** Humid air clinging to skin, the piano\u2019s ivory keys cool and slightly sticky.  \n    - **Taste:** Dust, condensation from a sweating glass of sweet tea.  \n- **Neighbors:** Mme. Leclerc (80s, widow in #720, feeds feral cats), Tyrell (street performer in #724, plays trumpet at dawn).  \n- **Landmark:** A live oak at the corner of Dumaine and Chartres, its trunk carved with decades of initials.  \n\n**2. Club Nuit Rouge, Bourbon Street**  \n- **Physical Description:** A 19th-century Creole townhouse turned jazz club. Peeling scarlet door, black-marble bar lit by Tiffany lamps. The main room (40x60 ft) has a vaulted ceiling with exposed cypress beams. A stage framed by blood-red velvet curtains holds a baby grand piano (middle C key slightly flat). The back courtyard (30x30 ft) has a stone fountain filled with cigarette butts and a single koi fish.  \n- **Senses:**  \n  - **Sight:** Gold fleur-de-lis wallpaper, smoke curling under emergency exit signs, the bartender\u2019s dragon tattoo (coiling up his neck).  \n  - **Sound:** Saxophone vibrato, ice clinking in bourbon glasses, a ceiling fan\u2019s arrhythmic squeak.  \n  - **Smell:** Spilled Sazerac, sweat, Chanel No. 5.  \n  - **Touch:** Sticky tabletops, the piano bench\u2019s cracked leather.  \n  - **Taste:** Burn of cheap whiskey, salt from roasted pecans sold outside.  \n- **Owner:** Marcel \u201cBig Mac\u201d Boudreaux (6\u20194\u201d, scar across his throat from a bar fight).  \n\n**3.

Industrial steel door (code: 1892\u2014the year his great-grandfather opened a photography studio). Open-concept 1,200 sq ft space: exposed brick, concrete floors stained with developer chemicals. A darkroom hides behind a sliding barn door (red lightbulb, smell of acetic acid).  \n- **Bedroom:** Mattress on the floor, black linen tangled. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook a banyan tree strung with Mardi Gras beads.  \n- **Senses:**  \n  - **Sight:** Police evidence photos pinned to a clothesline, a Leica camera disassembled on the kitchen island.  \n  - **Sound:** Miles Davis on a vintage record player, the hum of a mini-fridge.  \n  - **Smell:** Darkroom chemicals, espresso brewing, a hint of bergamot from his cologne.  \n- **Landmark:** The Parisian La Croix Bakery across the street\u20146 AM croissant runs, butter scent wafting through his windows.  \n\n**4.

The back room has a smuggler\u2019s tunnel sealed since 1809.  \n\n---\n\n**Social & Cultural Context:**  \nThe jazz community is tight-knit, protective of its own. Old Creole families resent tech millionaires buying up shotgun houses. Police are distrusted; crime scenes become Instagram fodder. Voodoo isn\u2019t magic here\u2014just herbal shops and tourists buying gris-gris bags.  \n\n**Atmosphere:**  \nSultry, seductive, claustrophobic. Thunderstorms erupt without warning. Neon reflects in rain puddles. Music is everywhere\u2014brass bands, piano drift, the hum of a bass through open windows.  \n\nCONTINUE"
