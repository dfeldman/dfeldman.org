**Word Count**: 3,600 | **Timeline**: June 3-5, 1929  

#### **Scene 1: The Metropolitan Museum Heist Gallery**  
**Setting**: Gallery 17, 10:00 AM. Heatwave glare fractures through stained glass, baking the stink of linseed oil and old stone. Vivian’s damp blouse clings to her spine as she kneels beside the Golden Throne replica, her father’s initials carved into the base.  
**Characters**: Vivian (Leica camera, frayed leather satchel), Guard Joe (holster digging into love handles, sweat blooming under arms), Celeste (docent disguise, cobalt paint flecking her cuticles).  
**Key Beats**:  
1. **Sensual Memory**: Vivian’s thumb grazes her father’s initials. *His Old Spice lingers—sandalwood and gun oil.* Sweat trickles between her breasts, pooling at her corset’s edge.  
2. **Violent Discovery**: A shadow shifts behind the Byzantine tapestry. She freezes—*the throne’s gold leaf flakes under her nail, fresh glue glistening.* Switchblade slashes her thigh. She disarms the thug, slamming his skull into marble. *Blood drips onto mosaics, metallic and sweet.*  
3. **Romantic Foreshadowing**: Vito leans in the doorway, silver lighter catching sunlight. “Curiosity’s a killer, Red.” He tosses it—*engraved “Rosa”* lands at her feet. His gaze rakes her torn stocking. Heat prickles her neck.  
4. **Clue**: Celeste “accidentally” spills Prussian blue paint—*same shade on tunnel maps in Vivian’s files.* The docent flees, trembling fingers leaving smears on the throne’s armrest.

**Key Beats**:

2. **Violence**: Thug gropes her—*Vito breaks his nose with a bottle.* Enzo’s laugh booms from shadows. “Teach her respect, boy.” Glass crunches under Vito’s boots as he steps closer, eyes dark.

Drawn from the **rot and glitter** of a New York that never sleeps, even in its grave.
