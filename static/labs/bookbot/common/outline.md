**Characters**: Vivian (alone, armed with a Leica camera), Guard Joe (shiftily adjusting his holster), Celeste (disguised as a docent, paint under her fingernails).  
**Key Beats**:  
1. **Sensual Memory**: Vivian’s fingertips trace her father’s initials carved into the marble base of the Golden Throne replica. *His Old Spice lingers in her mind—sandalwood and regret.* A bead of sweat slides between her breasts.  
2. **Discovery**: The throne’s gilding flakes under her nails—*fresh glue glistens, still tacky*. A shadow shifts behind a tapestry. She freezes, her camera strap biting into her neck.  
3. **Romantic Foreshadowing**: Vito leans against the doorway, sunlight catching the silver lighter in his hand. Their eyes lock. Heat prickles her neck. He tosses the lighter to her—*it lands at her feet, engraved “Rosa.”* “Careful, Red,” he drawls. “Curiosity’s a killer.”  
4. **Violence**: A thug lunges from the shadows. Switchblade grazes her thigh. She disarms him, slamming his head into the throne. *Blood drips onto Byzantine mosaics.* The scent of copper floods her nostrils.
