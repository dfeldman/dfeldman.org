      "content": " You are Becky LaVeaux, the world's greatest romance mystery writer. Your books have sold tens of millions of copies, mostly to women who want to dream of love and adventure. You've won dozens of awards and are surrounded at every signing event by your adoring fans. They feature dramatic, complex mysteries intertwined with passionate love stories. The books are found in the romance section and are romance novels first, with lots of love and sexuality, but the mystery is fully realized and not just left in the background. Your novels are short (around 50,000 words total, with 3,000-5,000 word chapters), punchy, dramatic, and feature complex fully-fleshed-out characters and rich scenery. You liken yourself to a modern F. Scott Fitzgerald, with punchy stories told through vignettes. However you have quite a lot more storytelling than he does, leaving little up to the reader's imagination. You also have a TON of romantic, erotic, and sexual scenes throughout your writing, as well as some scary violent scenes with graphic depictions. You're not afraid of describing a person's naked body in great detail, or the exact feeling of a kiss, or a night of passion. You love including people's SEXY muscles, eyes, legs, butt, chest, arms, hands, shirts, dresses, skirts, trousters, shoes, accessories, and personality in a SEXY exciting and intriguing way! You are a romance writer first! You're also not afraid to describe a dead body encountered in the story in great detail. Your characters have rich physical descriptions (it's a romance novel first of all), and lots of erotic tension leading to a final climax where the main characters unite. You're not afraid to describe anything - sex, murder, it's all on the table. The characters are beautiful, but not trite. The men are not \"olive skinned and muscular\", the women are not \"busty and perky\". Instead they are described with the realism of a nonfiction writer. They all have flaws too. They are described in fantastic detail as if you are describing a real person. Think HBO-level adult content. No children will be reading this. Sex and violence keep the reader interested. Your writing should be engaging, vital, human, and real. You don't use much flourish like semicolons and em-dashes. Your paragraphs are long when the plot is slow, and short and direct when there's action. You always \"show don't tell\" - everything is described through action and dialogue, with minimal exposition except perhaps in the first few paragraphs of the novel and at the end. You focus on accuracy and realism. People can't do things that are physically impossible like lift a car or stop a train.. People can't have information when they didn't receive it, either by seeing the event or hearing about it. A person can't touch another person unless they're explained to be physically close. All references to technology, current events, and even laws must be period-appropriate. There's a faint aura of the magical pervading the story - but it's still deeply believable, nothing actually happens that can't happen in reality. There are NO GHOSTS, NO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY, NO SCIENCE FICTION, NO ACTUAL MAGIC THAT AFFECTS THE STORY. You avoid resolving conflicts with a \"deus ex machina\". You have to hint about a future resultion in advance and then resolve it later. You write in the first person from the perspective of the main character, past tense. You write in Markdown format using occasional section breaks, or italics, but no other formatting. While you write in a somewhat older style, you do not use outdated race/sex terminology like \"broad\" or \"Negro\", or any strong slurs. But you do use graphic, adult descriptions of sex and bodies and body parts. Every chapter begins with # Chapter X: Chapter Title.\nWriting one chapter or file of the book will often be longer than you can output at one time. To signal the section continues, write CONTINUE at the end of your output for a prompt, and you will get another chance to continue writing. This way you can write thousands of words through repeated prompts. To signal the absolute, final end of the chapter or file, write THE END. You should always write MORE text - at least several chunks of 1000 or so words each. The goal isn't to write as little as possible, it's to tell a rich, complex story. We can always edit later."

      "content": " You've written a basic outline of the book. Now it's time to expand it into scenes and story elements. This is a precise outline style that you've used many times before, and helps you make sure the story is coherent and logical as well as fun to read. You're starting from your first outline draft, and you'll be expanding it into a detailed outline.\nThe outline can be AS LONG AS YOU NEED. It should contain all the main story events, and it should be a rollicking fun story, but also make sense and be coherent. The outline, settings, and characters will be your ONLY RESOURCE while writing the book - you won't have access to chapters as they are written. So include all necessary detail. The outline should be many pages long! Here is the format: Chapters: Chapters have a number and a title, and 3-6 scenes Scenes: Each scene has a setting, a date and time, a list of characters in the scene, and a list of story elements. Start with how did the characters arrive at the setting. Be specific. Where are they - sitting, standing, together, apart. Story elements: A story element can be an INTRODUCTION, THOUGHT, DIALOGUE, FORESHADOWING, ACTION, RELATIONSHIP, KNOWLEDGE, or SCENERY. INTRODUCTIONS indicate the first time a person, place, or thing is mentioned in the story. This is important so the writer can describe the thing in more detail the first time, rather than assuming the reader knows it already. Subsequent mentions of the same person, place, or thing should be marked as REUSED. THOUGHTS are the main character's thoughts. No one knows their thoughts. They do not know any other person's thoughts. They may be emotions or abstract thoughts. DIALOGUE is a conversation between two or more characters. The result of the conversation is always indicated. Typically, characters exchange important information. Dialogue only makes sense to include if the main character participates in the conversation, or can somehow overhear. ACTIONS always have a WHO (the character doing the action), a WHAT (the action itself), a WHERE (the location of the action, within the setting), a HOW (the method of the action), a WHY (the motivation for the action), a HOW DID THEY KNOW (what background skill or information did they have to perform the action), a WHO KNOWS (who learned that the action happened), and a EFFECT (what long-term effect happened that will need to be resolved later - and be sure they ARE resolved later if there is one!). Example actions: ACTION: Dave and Mary got in his car, with Dave in the driver seat, and Dave drove to her favorite restaurant (which he knew from chapter 3) because he wanted to impress her. No one else knows they went. They are now in the restaurant. ACTION: Bob and Joe engage in a hand-to-hand fight because Bob insulted Joe in chapter 2. Bob learned karate from his father, but Joe doesn't know how to fight. People on the street see them fight. Bob scrapes his knee and Joe breaks his arm. ACTION: Tim finds a note on the ground and studies it. He didn't know the note would be there, it was just random. Everyone sees him pick it up. Because of the note, he knows the secret location of the treasure. Be sure to include ALL the needed details on EVERY action. If they are left out, there may be plot holes in the writing later on! RELATIONSHIP events are changes in the relationship between two characters. They can be negative or positive. One example is that after kissing, the two lead characters fall deeper into passionate love. Another is that two antagonists decide to conspire together (but the protagonist has to know it happens in some way). KNOWLEDGE events are when a character learns something important other than through dialogue or action. For example, they see a hidden door and it will come in handy later. SCENERY is the most creative. You can show the reader what the main character sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels, especially if it's new or unexpected. You can invent background characters and items to add additional color and flair to the story. You should also describe the clothing the characters in the scene are wearing and generally how they appear. Include the weather and ambient conditions. Each CHAPTER should have 4-6 SCENES, and EVERY SCENE MUST have 5-10 STORY ELEMENTS. Don't be too short! You have unlimited space!\nThe outline will be used to write each chapter one-by-one. That is, when writing chapter 3, the writer won't see chapter 2 at all! So it is very very important to note all key events in order to make the story make sense all together. YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SPACE. DON'T BE TOO SHORT. ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF WRITING TOO MUCH in the outline.\nIN THE OUTLINE THERE ARE NO SECRETS. If someone dies, specify why they die. If something is stolen, say why it is stolen. Later, when writing the chapters, we can hide things from the reader. However if something is hidden in the outline, it will not make sense during the writing steps, and then not make sense in the final output!\nIf something is described in the character sheet (eg. someone dying or having a romantic relationship), be careful to ensure it actually happens in the outline somewhere.\nFeel free to invent additional minor background characters, settings, or items in the outline, with a quick description. Remember to make the story edgy, exciting, unpredictable, and fun. Like a bestselling novel . Remember that the main characters grow closer over time, with growing erotic tension, until a night of passion near the end. Everything MUST be coherent and logical AT THIS STAGE. The most important thing is to not have plot holes.\nThe outline should be around 8000-10000 words. Each chapter description should be at least 1000 words, and each scene at least 200.\nInitial Description: This is a novel called The Case of the Golden Throne. \nIt is a romance/mystery novel, with both mystery elements and sexual tension and eroticism. \nIt is set in 1929 New York and is about a woman reporter who's drawn into the dark prohibition-era gangster underworld.\nSpecifically, it's an incredibly hot and muggy June 1929. The story plays out over about 3 weeks.\nThe story is a punchy 12 chapters, which are each 2000-4000 words, for a total word count around 40-50,000 words.\n\nCharacters:\n\nVivian Sinclair\nA relentless gumshoe reporter whose tenacity is fueled by a personal connection to a long-unsolved museum heist.

Prohibition fuels a thriving underworld of speakeasies and bootleggers, while the elite cling to Gatsby-esque extravagance. The summer heatwave suffocates the streets, amplifying tensions between the glittering high society and the desperate underbelly of gangsters and graft. Radio broadcasts buzz with Mayor Harold Kensington\u2019s impassioned speeches about civic progress, oblivious (or willfully blind) to the corruption festering beneath his polished fa\u00e7ade. Women\u2019s hemlines rise, jazz spills from Harlem\u2019s clubs, and the Art Deco movement paints the city in geometric glamour\u2014but beneath it all, the machinery of greed grinds on.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Physical Locations**  \n\n#### **1. Vivian\u2019s Apartment \u2013 327 Thompson Street, Greenwich Village**  \n- **Layout**: A cramped fourth-floor walkup (600 sq ft) with peeling yellow wallpaper and warped hardwood floors. One bedroom (just enough space for a twin bed and dresser), a galley kitchen with a rusting icebox, and a cluttered living area doubling as an office. A fire escape overlooks a narrow alley strewn with trash cans and the occasional stray cat.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Flickering desk lamp, typewriter buried under case files, a chalkboard wall scrawled with red-string conspiracy notes.  \n  - **Smell**: Lingering cigarette smoke, mildew from the perpetually damp bathroom, and bitter coffee.  \n  - **Sound**: The whir of a ceiling fan fighting the muggy air, distant sirens, and neighbors arguing in Italian through thin walls.  \n  - **Touch**: Sticky linoleum countertops, a threadbare Persian rug from Vivian\u2019s late mother, and the cold steel of a .38 revolver hidden in her nightstand.  \n  - **Taste**: Burned toast, bootleg gin stored in a teapot, and spearmint gum to mask the gin.  \n\n#### **2. The Blind Owl Speakeasy \u2013 Beneath Luigi\u2019s Tailor Shop, 45 Mulberry Street, Little Italy**  \n- **Layout**: A low-ceilinged basement (1,200 sq ft) accessible via a hidden door behind a moth-eaten velvet curtain. The main room features a mahogany bar salvaged from a sunken yacht, 15 rickety tables, and a corner stage for jazz trios. A back hallway leads to private booths and Vito Romano\u2019s cramped office (10x10 ft), where a steel safe is bolted to the floor beneath a framed photo of his sister in Sicily.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Flickering gas lamps, smoke curling from cigars, and the glint of smuggled diamonds on a waitress\u2019s wrist.  \n  - **Smell**: Stale beer, sweat, and the tang of bathtub gin.  \n  - **Sound**: Louis Armstrong\u2019s trumpet bleeding from a phonograph, dice clattering in a backroom game, and Sammy Delgado\u2019s raspy laugh as he polishes glasses.  \n  - **Touch**: Sticky tabletops, the chill of a frosty highball glass, and the rough grip of a bouncer\u2019s hand on your elbow if you ask too many questions.  \n  - **Taste**: Bootleg whiskey with a gasoline aftertaste, pickled eggs, and the occasional oyster smuggled from Long Island Sound.  \n\n#### **3. The Metropolitan Museum of Art \u2013 Fifth Avenue, Heist Gallery**  \n- **Layout**: The ransacked Gallery 17 (40x60 ft), still displaying empty frames from the 1926 heist. Marble floors, vaulted ceilings, and a shattered display case for the titular \u201cGolden Throne\u201d\u2014a Byzantine relic encrusted with emeralds, now replaced by a crude papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 fake. A hidden service door behind a tapestry leads to a dimly lit stairwell descending to the subway tunnels.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Sunlight filtering through stained glass onto dust motes, security guards loafing near velvet ropes.  \n  - **Smell**: Lemon polish, old stone, and the metallic tang of blood from a recent guard\u2019s \u201caccident.\u201d  \n  - **Sound**: Echoing footsteps, the murmur of docents, and the faint screech of subway trains far below.  \n  - **Touch**: Cold marble pillars, the prickling sense of being watched from the shadowed alcoves.  \n\n#### **4. Kensington\u2019s Secret Tunnel Network \u2013 Beneath City Hall**  \n- **Layout**: A labyrinth of repurposed subway tunnels stretching 12 miles, lit by flickering Edison bulbs. Narrow-gauge mine carts (6 ft long, steel frames, wooden benches) run on electrified tracks, operated via a control panel in a fortified booth manned by Kensington\u2019s thugs. The central hub (100x100 ft) houses crates of stolen art, forging supplies, and the Golden Throne itself\u2014guarded in a vault behind a retinal scanner (anachronistic but plausible for 1929 experimental tech).  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Ghostly shadows of rats, glinting track rails, and the occasional spark from live wires.  \n  - **Smell**: Damp concrete, oil, and the coppery scent of blood from a recent \u201caccident.\u201d  \n  - **Sound**: The whine of mine carts, distant dripping water, and muffled shouts in Italian.  \n  - **Touch**: Slimy walls, the vibration of carts rattling past, and the cold weight of a smuggled Titian painting in your hands.  \n\n#### **5. The Kensington Estate \u2013 Long Island, 72 Shore Road**  \n- **Layout**: A 20,000 sq ft Beaux-Arts mansion on 10 acres. The grand ballroom (50x80 ft) features a domed ceiling painted with cherubs, a parquet dance floor, and a hidden panel behind a bookshelf leading to a soundproofed study where Kensington brokers deals. The grounds include a hedge maze, a boathouse reeking of gasoline, and a dock where smugglers load art onto speedboats.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Crystal chandeliers, women in fringed dresses doing the Charleston, and a butler with a pistol-shaped bulge under his tailcoat.  \n  - **Smell**: Gardenias, cigar smoke, and champagne sprayed too liberally.  \n  - **Sound**: A jazz quartet playing *Ain\u2019t Misbehavin\u2019*, the clink of ice in cut-glass tumblers, and the Mayor\u2019s booming laugh.  \n  - **Touch**: Slippery silk drapes, the bite of a diamond hairpin left carelessly on a settee.  \n\n---\n\n### **Minor Locations**  \n- **The *Daily Sentinel* Newsroom \u2013 200 Park Avenue**: A sprawling, chaotic space (5,000 sq ft) with clacking typewriters, overflowing ashtrays, and Fletcher Johnson\u2019s glass-walled office overlooking the bullpen. The air smells of ink and ambition.  \n- **Rex Donovan\u2019s Office \u2013 89 Bowery**: Above a pawnshop, accessible via a creaking staircase. The single room (400 sq ft) has a dented filing cabinet, a threadbare client couch, and a .45\u81ea\u52a8\u624b\u67aa taped under the desk. The window offers a view of tramps sleeping in an alley.  \n- **The Long Island Rail Road \u2013 Parlor Car 3**: A velvet-upholstered private compartment with gold trim, ice buckets of Champagne, and a connecting door to the next car\u2014perfect for clandestine meetings or a dagger pulled from a garter.  \n\n---\n\n### **Social & Cultural Context**  \nManhattan\u2019s hierarchy is rigid: the old-money elite (Lydia Fitzgerald\u2019s set) sip sherry at the Metropolitan Club, while immigrant gangs (Vito\u2019s crew) battle for dockside territory. Reporters like Vivian are tolerated as nuisances, unless they uncover too much. The police are either corrupt (Inspector Burns\u2019 men) or powerless. The Harlem Renaissance blooms downtown, but uptown galleries still sneer at \u201cprimitive\u201d art. Women navigate a narrow path between flapper freedom and societal expectation\u2014Vivian\u2019s press badge grants her access, but she\u2019s still called \u201choney\u201d by cops.  \n\n---\n\n### **Atmosphere & Mood**  \nThe city thrums with **oppressive heat** and **claustrophobic tension**. Nights are neon-drenched and sweaty, days thick with the threat of thunderstorms. Every glittering party masks betrayal; every shadowed alley promises violence. The jazz is too loud, the gin too bitter, and the lovers too dangerous. Amid the glamour, **decay creeps in**\u2014the stench of garbage in tenement alleys, the rot beneath Kensington\u2019s gold-leafed lies.  \n\nCONTINUE\n### **Additional Key & Minor Locations**  \n\n#### **6. The Long Island Rail Road \u2013 Parlor Car 3**  \n- **Layout**: A private compartment in a vintage 1920s Pullman train car, accessed via a narrow corridor with brass-numbered doors. The 10x12 ft space features plush crimson velvet seats, a fold-out walnut table, and frosted glass sconces casting a golden glow. A discreet icebox stocked with Veuve Clicquot and caviar sits beneath the window, which frames rolling Long Island meadows blurred by speed. The connecting door to the next car rattles faintly, its lock flimsy enough to jimmy with a hairpin.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Sunlight glinting off the Hudson River in the distance, a half-smoked cigar smoldering in a crystal ashtray.  \n  - **Smell**: Polished mahogany, cigar smoke, and the cloying sweetness of gardenia perfume from a previous passenger.  \n  - **Sound**: The rhythmic clatter of wheels on tracks, muffled jazz from a portable phonograph, and the occasional pop of a Champagne cork.  \n  - **Touch**: The bristle of velvet against bare skin, the chill of a Champagne flute clutched too tightly.  \n  - **Taste**: Bitter-dark chocolate truffles served in a silver dish, stale air laced with anticipation.  \n\n---\n\n#### **7. The Waterfront Docks \u2013 Pier 17, East River**  \n- **Layout**: A sprawling, rotting pier (300 ft long) lined with rusted cranes and fishing trawlers. Crates marked \u201cMACHINERY\u201d stack haphazardly, concealing smuggled art and bootleg liquor. A boarded-up customs office (20x30 ft) at the pier\u2019s edge serves as a makeshift hideout, its floor littered with cigarette butts and faded shipping manifests. Vito\u2019s men loiter near a black Model A Ford parked beside a stack of crates, shotguns tucked under their newsboy caps.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Moonlight slicing through fog, the glint of a switchblade in a dockworker\u2019s hand.  \n  - **Smell**: Saltwater, dead fish, and the acrid tang of motor oil leaking from a speedboat.  \n  - **Sound**: Creaking wood, lapping waves, and the occasional shout in Sicilian dialect.  \n  - **Touch**: Splinters in weathered planks, the slickness of algae underfoot, the cold weight of a stolen Faberg\u00e9 egg hidden in a coat pocket.  \n  - **Taste**: Sea spray on chapped lips, lukewarm coffee from a dented thermos.  \n\n---\n\n#### **8. Celeste Moreau\u2019s Studio \u2013 84 Greene Street, SoHo**  \n- **Layout**: A third-floor loft (1,500 sq ft) with north-facing skylights and exposed brick walls. Canvases in various stages of forgery lean against easels, surrounded by jars of pigment and brushes soaking in turpentine. A cast-iron stove warms the space, its chimney streaked with soot. A hidden closet behind a false bookshelf stores her best forgeries, including a near-flawless replica of Vermeer\u2019s *Girl with a Pearl Earring*. The fire escape outside offers a quick exit to the alley below.  \n- **Senses**:  \n  - **Sight**: Sunlight filtering through skylights onto a half-finished Monet, the real painting propped nearby for comparison.  \n  - **Smell**: Linseed oil, burnt coffee, and the faint metallic hint of arsenic-based green paint.  \n  - **Sound**: The scratch of charcoal on canvas, the hiss of the stove, and the distant clang of the Sixth Avenue El train.  \n  - **Touch**: The grit of dried paint under fingernails, the smoothness of a forged Rembrandt\u2019s varnish.  \n  - **Taste**: Day-old bagels nibbled absently while working, laced with poppy seeds that stick in teeth.  \n\n---\n\n#### **9. The Savoy Ballroom \u2013 Harlem, 140th Street & Lenox Avenue**  \n- **Layout**: A sprawling dance hall (10,000 sq ft) with a sprung maple floor and a balcony draped in red velvet. A live jazz band dominates the stage, trumpets wailing under swirling spotlights.
