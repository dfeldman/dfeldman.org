### **Chapter 1: Dust & Desire**  
**Word Count**: 3,600 | **Timeline**: June 3-5, 1929  

#### **Scene 1: The Metropolitan Museum Heist Gallery**  
**Setting**: Gallery 17, 10:00 AM. Heatwave glare fractures through stained glass, baking the stink of linseed oil and old stone. Vivian’s damp blouse clings to her spine as she kneels beside the Golden Throne replica, her father’s initials carved into the base.  
**Characters**: Vivian (Leica camera, frayed leather satchel), Guard Joe (holster digging into love handles, sweat blooming under arms), Celeste (docent disguise, cobalt paint flecking her cuticles).  
**Key Beats**:  
1. **Sensual Memory**: Vivian’s thumb grazes her father’s initials. *His Old Spice lingers—sandalwood and gun oil.* Sweat trickles between her breasts, pooling at her corset’s edge.  
2. **Violent Discovery**: A shadow shifts behind the Byzantine tapestry. She freezes—*the throne’s gold leaf flakes under her nail, fresh glue glistening.* Switchblade slashes her thigh. She disarms the thug, slamming his skull into marble. *Blood drips onto mosaics, metallic and sweet.*  
3. **Romantic Foreshadowing**: Vito leans in the doorway, silver lighter catching sunlight. “Curiosity’s a killer, Red.” He tosses it—*engraved “Rosa”* lands at her feet. His gaze rakes her torn stocking. Heat prickles her neck.  
4. **Clue**: Celeste “accidentally” spills Prussian blue paint—*same shade on tunnel maps in Vivian’s files.* The docent flees, trembling fingers leaving smears on the throne’s armrest.  

#### **Scene 2: Daily Sentinel Newsroom**  
**Setting**: 2:30 PM. Overhead fans churn cigar smoke into a soupy haze. A headline blares: **“MAYOR VOWS CLEANUP AMID HEATWAVE CRISES.”**  
**Characters**: Vivian (bloodied stocking, clacking typewriter keys), Fletcher (ashtray overflowing, crumpling her draft), Freddie (monocle fogged, perched on her desk).  
**Key Beats**:  
1. **Conflict**: Fletcher burns her article with his cigar. “Chase ghosts, you’ll haunt the gutter.” Embers curl the edges of her father’s photo. She grinds the ashes under her heel.  
2. **Betrayal Hint**: Eleanor’s coded note slips from a file: *“Follow the blue. —Madame X.”* Lavender scent lingers—*Eleanor’s signature.*  
3. **Provocation**: Freddie slips a train ticket into her garter. “Midnight, darling. Bring the lighter.” His thumb grazes her inner thigh, *stubble scraping skin.* She knees his groin. “Next time, aim higher.”  

#### **Scene 3: The Blind Owl Speakeasy**  
**Setting**: Midnight. Neon bleeds through boarded windows, painting Vito’s scarred knuckles crimson. A broken phonograph wails Bessie Smith’s *Empty Bed Blues.*  
**Characters**: Vivian (gin-stained sleeves, hip against the bar), Vito (stitching her thigh wound, jaw tight), Enzo’s Thug (unconscious, facedown in rye).  
**Key Beats**:  
1. **Erotic Tension**: Vito dabs iodine on her gash. *His breath hitches as her skirt rides higher.* “You cost me a grand tonight,” he lies, fingers skimming lace.  
2. **Violence**: Thug gropes her—*Vito breaks his nose with a bottle.* Enzo’s laugh booms from shadows. “Teach her respect, boy.” Glass crunches under Vito’s boots as he steps closer, eyes dark.  
3. **Clue**: Torn manifest in thug’s pocket: *“Golden Throne → Pier 17. Midnight. Eyes only.”* Paper reeks of saltwater and lies.

**Characters**: Vivian (father’s pocket watch clenched in fist), Rex (yellowed undershirt, whiskey tremor), Freddie (eavesdropping, monocle cracked).  
**Key Beats**:  
1. **Betrayal**: Rex slams a 1926 police report. “Your dad died a thief.” *She cracks his jaw with the watch.* Gears spill like secrets.  
2. **Clue**: Coded margin note: *“Kensington’s signature on Exhibit B.”* Eleanor deciphers: *“Tunnels under City Hall. Follow the blue.”*

#### **Scene 2: Pier 17 Smuggle Den**  
**Setting**: Noon. Rotting fish and gasoline sting the air. Gulls scream above crates marked *“MACHINERY.”*

2. **Mystery**: Celeste's map flutters in the chaos—*retinal scanner schematic* with scrawled note: "Pluck his eye or blind him." Paper crumbles to ash. Vivian spots *XVII* carved into tunnel wall—matches Gallery 17 coordinates.  

3. **Romantic Tension**: Vivian bandages Vito's bullet graze in flickering light. *His thumb brushes her lip.* "Why’d you follow me?" She yanks the bandage tight. "You’re a terrible liar." The cart jolts—*bodies press together, breath mingling with gunpowder stench.*
