Characters:

Vivian Sinclair
A relentless gumshoe reporter whose tenacity is fueled by a personal connection to a long-unsolved museum heist. Grounded by a network of gritty contacts and a sharp intellect, she skillfully navigates both the high-society circles and the dangerous underbelly of Manhattan. She often goes by Viv.

Rex Donovan
A seasoned PI with a checkered past and a wealth of street knowledge. His guarded mentorship and occasional hints of personal regret provide Vivian with crucial leads—while his ambiguous loyalties add layers to the investigation.

Vito Romano
A low-level gangster whose charm and inner conflict slowly reveal a capacity for tenderness. Initially an enigmatic suspect, his gradual, hard-earned connection with Vivian evolves into a passionate yet cautious romance, built on mutual risk and shared secrets.

Mayor Harold Kensington
Manhattan’s impeccably polished yet ruthlessly corrupt leader. Behind a veneer of civic pride, he meticulously orchestrates an audacious scheme: channeling city funds into a clandestine network that smuggles priceless art via hidden tunnels. His control over the city’s institutions is both his strength and his undoing. Harold is everpresent throughout the book, and his ego-driven political activities are mentioned in the newspaper, radio, billboards, and casual conversation. (But not his dark secret of course.)

Celeste Moreau
A brilliant, enigmatic art forger whose artistry conceals her conflicted role within the criminal enterprise. Torn between survival and her own secret ambitions, she provides critical evidence of the Mayor’s elaborate deception.

Charles Beaumont
A dazzling socialite whose unexpected murder at a high-society event ripples through the elite. His death not only unveils hidden alliances but also propels the investigation into unexpected, darker corridors.

Lydia Fitzgerald
A refined debutante with sharp insights into Manhattan’s exclusive circles. Her subtle clues and discreet intelligence help Vivian untangle the labyrinthine web of society’s secrets.

Freddie Winslow
A debonair heir known for his scandalous exploits and keen observational skills. His offhand revelations during lavish gatherings hint at the existence of the secret tunnel network and further entangle the social elite in the mystery.

Fletcher Johnson
The formidable newspaper editor whose exacting standards and unyielding pursuit of truth compel Vivian to probe deeper, even at great personal risk.

Sammy Delgado
A wry, observant bartender at a notorious speakeasy. His knack for catching whispered secrets amid the clamor of Manhattan’s nightlife often supplies the missing puzzle pieces.

Inspector Bobbie Burns
A hardened detective balancing personal honor and the demands of a corrupt system. His covert investigations into the Mayor’s sphere of influence blur the lines between law enforcement and the underworld.

Eleanor Brooks
A reserved confidante with mysterious ties to the city’s darker corners. Her quiet revelations and discreet support prove indispensable as Vivian digs into the layers of deception.
