Based on the materials below, create a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline of the book. For each chapter, include:
- Chapter number and title
- Main plot points and events
- Character arcs and developments
- Key scenes and their purposes
- Emotional beats and tone

The outline should be enough to make a coherent story, without plot holes. For example if someone dies or 
gets injured, they can't return healthy later on. Characters can't appear or disappear without explanation. 
Items can't appear or disappear for no reason. Side characters can't abruptly move with no explanation (the main characters do travel though). The weather or date can't abruptly change.
You will write each chapter individually, without seeing the other chapters, so the outline as a whole needs to make sense. 
Also include a rough length for each chapter, in words.

Format each chapter clearly and show how the story progresses. End with "THE END".
