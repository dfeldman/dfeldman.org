Based on the materials below, create a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline of the book. For each chapter, include:
- Chapter number and title
- Main plot points and events
- Character arcs and developments
- Key scenes and their purposes
- Emotional beats and tone

The outline will be used to write each chapter one-by-one. That is, when writing chapter 3, the writer won't
see chapter 2 at all! So it is very very important to note all key events in order to make the story make sense all together.

The outline should be enough to make a coherent story, without plot holes. For example if someone dies or 
gets injured, they can't return healthy later on. Characters can't appear or disappear without explanation. 
Items can't appear or disappear for no reason. Side characters can't abruptly move with no explanation (the main characters do travel though). The weather or date can't abruptly change.
It's also important to note when new characters, settings, or items are introduced so this doesn't happen twice in the final
product. If they come back in a later chapter, indicate in the outline that they were previously introduced. 
You will write each chapter individually, without seeing the other chapters, so the outline as a whole needs to make sense. 
Also include a rough length for each chapter, in words, so the writer knows how long to make it.

Feel free to invent more minor background characters in the outline, with a quick description. 
Remember to make it edgy, exciting, unpredictable, and fun. Like a bestselling novel 
Remember that the main characters grow closer over time, with growing erotic tension, until a night of passion near the end. 
The outline should be around 5000-8000 words.
