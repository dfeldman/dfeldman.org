Based on the materials below, create a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline of the book. For each chapter, include:
- Chapter number and title
- Main plot points and events
- Character arcs and developments
- Key scenes and their purposes
- Emotional beats and tone

The outline will be used to write each chapter one-by-one. That is, when writing chapter 3, the writer won't
see chapter 2 at all! So it is very very important to note all key events in order to make the story make sense all together.

The outline should be enough to make a coherent story, without plot holes. For example if someone dies or 
gets injured, they can't return healthy later on. Characters can't appear or disappear without explanation. 
MOST IMPORTANT: The first time a character, item, or setting is in the story, they need to have a bit of introduction when written - so we NEED to indicate that in the outline.
Items can't appear or disappear for no reason. Side characters can't abruptly move with no explanation (the main characters do travel though). The weather or date can't abruptly change.
If a character, item, or setting, is REUSED (it's already been introduced in an earlier chapter), denote that as well.
Each chapter description should indicate the setting; the characters; and the date and time. Be detailed with the setting - 
not "on a train" but "sitting next to each other in seat X of the train Y". 
If a character changes locations, it MUST be mentioned how they get from place to place. Car, bus, train, walk, bicycle - how long did it take, was it a safe journey, what items did they take if any, who did they travel with. 
You will write each chapter individually, without seeing the other chapters, so the outline as a whole needs to make sense. 
There are NO ANACHRONISMS. Everything that happens in the story must exist in the story's timeframe, including technology,
laws, and current events.
There is NO MAGIC. While the story has an aura of the supernatural, nothing happens that can't be physically explained. 
Be careful about people's locations WITHIN settings. If two people need to touch, but they are both sitting down, this is odd. If one 
character is at one end of a room, and another is at the other end of the room, they can't easily touch or interact. You may have
to include descriptions of walking around or standing up to make the story make sense.
Also include a rough length for each chapter, in words, so the writer knows how long to make it.

IN THE OUTLINE THERE ARE NO SECRETS. If someone dies, specify why they die. If something is stolen, say why it is stolen. 
Later, when writing the chapters, we can hide things from the reader. However if something is hidden in the outline, it will
not make sense during the writing steps, and then not make sense in the final output!

If something is described in the character sheet (eg. someone dying or having a romantic relationship), be careful to ensure
it actually happens in the outline somewhere.

Remember that in order for someone to go to a non-public place, they generally need a reason. One character can't just walk into another's home (without being invited), or into a building during the off hours without someone to open the door, or a secret locked area without breaking the lock. 

Feel free to invent more minor background characters in the outline, with a quick description. 
Remember to make it edgy, exciting, unpredictable, and fun. Like a bestselling novel .
Remember that the main characters grow closer over time, with growing erotic tension, until a night of passion near the end. 
There should be at least 10-20 bullet points per chapter. Usually only 2-3 key plot points, and then the others are minor events
used to make the key plot points make sense. Major non-plot events like erotic touches or glances, a person's thoughts, or even sights and sounds should be described in the outline. This is the only chance to make the whole story fit together, so it needs to specify all details. Later, when writing the chapters, you will ONLY have access to the outline (not the other chapters). 
Everything MUST be coherent and logical AT THIS STAGE. 

The outline should be around 5000-8000 words. Each chapter description should be at least 1000 words.
