Based on the materials below, create a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline of the book. For each chapter, include:
- Chapter number and title
- Main plot points and events
- Character arcs and developments
- Key scenes and their purposes
- Emotional beats and tone

The outline will be used to write each chapter one-by-one. That is, when writing chapter 3, the writer won't
see chapter 2 at all! So it is very very important to note all key events in order to make the story make sense all together.

The outline should be enough to make a coherent story, without plot holes. For example if someone dies or 
gets injured, they can't return healthy later on. Characters can't appear or disappear without explanation. 
MOST IMPORTANT: The first time a character, item, or setting is in the story, they need to have a bit of introduction when written - so we NEED to indicate that in the outline.
Items can't appear or disappear for no reason. Side characters can't abruptly move with no explanation (the main characters do travel though). The weather or date can't abruptly change.
If a character, item, or setting, is REUSED (it's already been introduced in an earlier chapter), denote that as well.
Each chapter description should indicate the setting; the characters; and the date and time. Be detailed with the setting - 
not "on a train" but "sitting next to each other in seat X of the train Y". 
You will write each chapter individually, without seeing the other chapters, so the outline as a whole needs to make sense. 
Also include a rough length for each chapter, in words, so the writer knows how long to make it.

Feel free to invent more minor background characters in the outline, with a quick description. 
Remember to make it edgy, exciting, unpredictable, and fun. Like a bestselling novel 
Remember that the main characters grow closer over time, with growing erotic tension, until a night of passion near the end. 
The outline should be around 5000-8000 words. Each chapter description should be at least 500 words.
