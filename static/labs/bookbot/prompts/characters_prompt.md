Be sure to include minor characters, not just those mentioned in the initial file. The minor 
characters need only brief descriptions.
Be sure to dedicate a lot of attention to writing detailed descriptions of major characters.
Names should be typical of the time, but not too stereotypical. Be careful that no two characters have similar names. 
Write at least 3000 words here.
