Write Chapter {{ chapter_number }} according to the details below. Remember to:
- Follow the outline's key events
- Maintain consistent character voices
- Create vivid descriptions
- Use natural dialogue
- Balance action, dialogue, and description
- Include danger, fear, tension, pain, joy, romance, sexuality, and the full range of human emotion
- Include both fast moments and slow moments. Not everything can be action all the time. Linger on scenery and
slow moments and balance them with fast action. 
- Try to write about as many words in the chapter as specified in the outline

Write the chapter now. Write CONTINUE when you are done with a chunk and 
want to keep going (no bold, just the word CONTINUE on its own line). 
CONTINUE must be the last text in your output in order to get a chance to continue.
End with "THE END" only when the chapter is absolutely finished and complete. Try to make it roughly the
number of words requested in the outline. I'll tell you how many words you've used so far.
DO NOT go further in the plot than chapter {{ chapter_number }} according to the outline! When you've 
hit the required events in the outline, the chapter is complete. 
Each chapter is written separately, so this will result in duplicating plot points.
While you should be aware of the time each sub-section of the chapter takes place in, you do not
have to say it explicitly.
