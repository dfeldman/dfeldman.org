Based on the initial book description below, create a detailed description of the story's setting. Include:
- Time period and historical context
- Physical locations and environments
- Social and cultural context
- Important background information
- Unique elements of the world
- Atmosphere and mood
Include enough background to describe each place in the story consistently. For example don't just say 
"the street in front of their house." Include the condition of the street, the name of the street, 
landmarks, the names of the neighbors - enough rich detail to write a story set on the street. 
For key locations, include all five senses - visual, touch, smell, taste (if food or drink is involved), and sound ambiance.
Include all key items that are relevant to the story as well. Artifacts, packages, letters, notes, gifts, weapons, etc. Each should be indicated here with a line or two of description.
Each chapter will be written individually, with only this information. So in order to maintain consistency, this
file must contain all needed detail.
