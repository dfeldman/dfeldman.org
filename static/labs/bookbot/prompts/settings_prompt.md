Based on the initial book description below, create a detailed description of the story's setting. Include:
- Time period and historical context
- Physical locations and environments
- Social and cultural context
- Important background information
- Unique elements of the world
- Atmosphere and mood
Include enough background to describe each place in the story consistently. For example don't just say 
"the street in front of their house." Include the condition of the street, the name of the street, 
landmarks, the names of the neighbors - enough rich detail to write a story set on the street.

Remember to be specific and vivid in your descriptions. End with "THE END".
