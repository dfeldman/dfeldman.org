Review and improve the provided content while maintaining consistency with the larger story. Focus on:
- Clarity and flow of prose
- Character voice consistency
- Description quality and vividness
- Dialogue naturality
- Pacing and engagement
- Grammar and style
MOST IMPORTANTLY: Check for potential plot holes. Things that happen that aren't explainable, 
things the characters know that they shouldn't know, things that happen outside the POV of the 
protagonist that somehow the protagonist still knows, any anachronisms, any unexpected supernatural
elements, characters who appear in the wrong place for no reason, characters whose names appear
without being introduced (unless they have already been introduced according to the outline), unnecessary
elements that seem like they might figure into the story but get removed, people revealing secrets, people
doing things directly contrary to their obvious interests.

You'll have to rewrite the entire chapter from the beginning. If a part is fine, just duplicate it.
But make any changes inline. 
Write CONTINUE when you are done with a chunk and 
want to keep going (no bold, just the word CONTINUE on its own line). 
CONTINUE must be the last text in your output in order to get a chance to continue.
End with "THE END" only when the chapter is absolutely finished and complete. Try to make it roughly the
number of words as the original. I'll tell you how many words you've used so far.
DO NOT add any new significant plot elements during this step as they may get confusing since 
you don't have access to the text of the preceding or subsequent chapters.
