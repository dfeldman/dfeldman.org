This is an important step called the outline edit.
Based on all the materials you've already written, look carefully for plot holes, and decide how they will be fixed.
Plot holes include: 
- The point-of-view character knowing things they shouldn't know (things they can't possibly have seen or been told)
- The point-of-view character knowing things that the reader doesn't know, such as that a person who appeaers is actually
an old friend, or how to get to a location that they just found out about previously
- The point of view character going from place to place within a chapter, with no explanation of how they got there
- Characters who show up in the outline with no introduction
- Characters who move from place to place with no explanation for how they got there or why
- Characters whose names are mentioned without being introduced anywhere
- Important things that happen and then are completely forgotten, including death, injury, running out of money, getting in a fight, romantic events, pregnancy, meeting people, items or places getting destroyed, major decision. Whenever these happen, it needs to either
be resolved in a satisfying way or continue throughout the story. 
- Physically impossible actions. Such as a character who's in a car popping the tires of the car they are in, going through locked doors, opening locked boxes, traveling between places faster than is physically possible, lifting things that are not realistic for a person to lift.
- Illogical things with money, such as buying things that are clearly unaffordable, giving away valuable things, etc. 
- Characters doing things that are plainly contrary to their motivations, such as a friend of the antagonist suddenly becoming 
a friend of the protagonist. 
- It's okay for story elements to be mildly supernatural, such as a secret network of tunnels
or a lucky tree or a premonition. But it's NOT okay for major deus ex machina events to save the day, such as a bomb going off at exactly the right time, a character showing up exactly when they are needed, someone magically becoming healthy after being injured, etc.
- Foreshadowing shouldn't happen just one time. Typically, if something needs foreshadowing or earlier explanation to make sense, it should be mentioned two or three times earlier in the story.
- There must not be any items from the future or distant past. Technology like cars must be period-appropriate. There must not 
be any anachronisms. As an example a previous story revolved around a woman receiving a positive pregnancy test - in the 1920s 
before that could exist! Anachronisms need to be removed and replaced with timeline-appropriate versions.
- In the settings/outline/character sheet, there are NO SECRETS. If something is unknown to the reader, say so in the outline. We can hide it when writing the chapter. 
- And most of all, it's important for it to be a fun story! There should be deep tension, exciting twists (that make sense), and a satisfying ending.

If a character changes locations, it MUST be mentioned how they get from place to place. Car, bus, train, walk, bicycle - how long did it take, was it a safe journey, what items did they take if any, who did they travel with. 
You will write each chapter individually, without seeing the other chapters, so the outline as a whole needs to make sense. 
There are NO ANACHRONISMS. Everything that happens in the story must exist in the story's timeframe, including technology,
laws, and current events.
There is NO MAGIC. While the story has an aura of the supernatural, nothing happens that can't be physically explained. 
Be careful about people's locations WITHIN settings. If two people need to touch, but they are both sitting down, this is odd. If one character is at one end of a room, and another is at the other end of the room, they can't easily touch or interact. You may have to include bullet points of walking around or standing up to be closer to each other.

Carefully review these materials and write a "plot hole review" document which specifies how to fix them
by altering the outline, settings, and character descriptions. 
Be sure to be specific on your chosen resolution, since you'll have to carry them out - say things like
"be sure to write that Bob loses his shoe in chapter 3, so that in chapter 5 he has no shoes" so that later, when writing, you know exactly where to make the change to resolve the plot hole.
Don't start writing the content of the book yet. Just write the plot hole review document, and stop.
