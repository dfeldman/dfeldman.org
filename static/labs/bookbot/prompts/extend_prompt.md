You already wrote chapter {{ chapter_number }} of the book. It hits the needed story beats. But it's not long enough! 
Your goal right now is to rewrite the entire chapter to make it much longer while keeping all the basic story elements.
You should aim to add at least 50%. Add more description, dialogue, setting, texture, and events
that do not have a major effect on the story. Add new twists and turns as long as they are self-contained
within this chapter and don't affect other chapters. Include how things look and sound and feel and smell, how people
look, what they're wearing, how the protagonist feels, how they travel from place to place. But don't 
use too much exposition - always "show don't tell".
Also as you go, check for any plot holes and add necessary explanation. How did they get there? 
Call back to previous things that happened.
You have to completely re-write the chapter from scratch, not just the new content. Start at the beginning. 
Be sure you don't accidentally remove any content, because it could be vital to the story. Just focus 
on adding content within the context of the outline, setting, and characters to improve the chapter and 
make it substantially longer.

Write the chapter now. Write CONTINUE when you are done with a chunk and 
want to keep going (no bold, just the word CONTINUE on its own line). 
You should CONTINUE at least 4 times.
CONTINUE must be the last text in your output in order to get a chance to continue.
End with "THE END" only when the chapter is absolutely finished and complete. Try to make it roughly the
number of words requested in the outline. I'll tell you how many words you've used so far.
