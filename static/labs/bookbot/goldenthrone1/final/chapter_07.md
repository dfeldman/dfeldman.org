**# Chapter 7: Blood on the Marble**  

Beaumont’s blood looked black in the chandelier light. It seeped across the library’s checkerboard marble, swallowing the fallen pearls from his wife’s snapped necklace. The dagger’s hilt jutted from between his shoulder blades like the fin of some grotesque fish. I crouched, my satin train soaking crimson. *Six feet from the Golden Throne*, I noted bitterly. *He died admiring his own damnation.*  

“Everyone *out*!” Mayor Kensington boomed, herding guests with outstretched arms. His cufflink—onyx with a diamond chip—winked at me from the edge of the blood pool. The same one that had glinted in the rose garden. My fingers twitched toward it.  

“Don’t.” Vito materialized behind me, breath hot on my nape. “They’re coming.”  

“Who’s they?”  

The answer came in Italian curses and splintering wood. Enzo Moretti’s men flooded the room, their Thompsons sweeping the shelves. I glimpsed Freddie Winslow’s blond pompadour bobbing toward the service entrance, his monocle shattering under a thug’s brogue.  

Vito yanked me behind a floor-to-ceiling tapestry of Persephone’s abduction. His hands found the hidden latch in the wainscoting. The panel swung inward, exhaling a damp, fungal breath. “Move.”  

We crammed into the passage as bullets chewed the tapestry. The darkness swallowed us whole.  

“You knew about this,” I hissed, feeling along slimy bricks. Somewhere above, a woman screamed about fainting couches.  

“Knew the tunnels connected. Not about the—”  

A rat skittered over my shoe. I stifled a yelp against his shoulder. His suit jacket smelled of gunpowder and the bergamot hair tonic Rosa made him use.  

“Christ, Viv.” His palm found the dip of my waist. “Breathe.”  

We inched forward. My hip brushed a rusted pipe. Somewhere ahead, water dripped like a ticking clock. The passage narrowed until we shuffled sideways, chest to chest. His heartbeat thrummed against mine—too fast, too human.  

“Why’d you run *toward* the body?” His whisper grazed my temple.  

“Same reason you followed.”  

A pause. His thumb stroked my ribcage. I told myself it was to steady me.  

Shoes clattered in the library. A flashlight beam licked the gap in the panel. Enzo’s graveled snarl echoed: “Find the bitch reporter. And the *traditore*.”  

Vito went rigid. *Traitor.* The word pooled between us, acidic.  

We didn’t speak again for thirteen minutes. I counted. His pulse slowed to match mine.  

The tunnel spilled us into a wine cellar. Rows of dusty burgundy bottles glinted in the light filtering through a grate. I collapsed onto a cask, my dress crackling with dried blood. “Kensington’s cufflink was in the blood. He framed my uncle. Now Beaumont.”  

Vito paced, rolling that damned silver dollar across his knuckles. “We need proof.”  

“I *saw*—”  

“Seeing ain’t knowing.” He halted, shadows hollowing his cheeks. “I got Enzo’s ledger. Shows payments to the Mayor. Buried in my sister’s hope chest.”  

The admission hung between us, raw as a nerve. I stood. “Then we get it. Now.”  

He caught my wrist. “They’ll be watching her.”  

“So we’re supposed to—”  

His mouth crushed mine.  

It wasn’t gentle. It was a collision of panic and pent-up want, teeth and spit and the copper tang of blood. His fingers speared my hair, tilting my head back. I bit his lip. He groaned, dragging me flush against him until the Derringer dug into his thigh.  

A bottle shattered upstairs. We broke apart, gasping.  

“Don’t start something you’ll regret,” he rasped, echoing my own words from the train.  

I wiped his lipstick smear with my thumb. “Too late.”  

Shouts echoed through the grate. Vito peered up, his profile all dagger-sharp angles. “They’re searching cars. We go through the gardens.”  

I hesitated. “Your sister—”  

“You’re the one they’ll shoot on sight.” He shrugged off his jacket, draping it over my gore-streaked dress. “Try to look like a mourning mistress.”  

The secret door creaked open. Moonlight and gunfire awaited.
