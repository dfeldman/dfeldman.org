**# Chapter 3: The Art of Disappearing**  

Delancey Street hunted corpses. I counted twelve moldering mattresses in the tenement’s foyer, springs curled like fossilized ribcages. The address from Rex’s matchbook leered in peeling gilt numbers above a door boarded with nails rusted to sepia tears. My flashlight beam sliced through grime-coated air. Blood spatter clung to the walls, old as sin.  

“Nowhere to go but down,” I whispered to Arthur’s ghost. He’d preferred attics.  

The coal chute crouched behind a cairn of firebricks, its iron hinges shrieking betrayal. I slid into the void, knees scraping through a century of soot. My blouse caught on a nail, tearing free with the sound of a violinist’s last breath.  

Greenish light flickered below.  

The tunnels stank of wet earth and ozone. Narrow-gauge tracks gleamed under bare bulbs strung like witchlights. I pressed against a sweating brick pillar as voices echoed.  

“…Thursday’s shipment,” growled a sandpapered baritone. “Throne goes to the docks, same as the Rembrandt.”  

A younger voice: “Who’s moving it?”  

“Same bastards who shut Lowell’s trap permanent.” Ragged laughter. “Boss don’t care if we sail it or sink it, long as the mayor gets paid.”  

*Mayor.* My pulse thrummed. The flashlight slipped in my clammy grip.  

A distant train horn drowned their retreating footsteps. Silence rushed in, thick as clotting blood. My beam trembled over tracks, then caught on something pale.  

A hand.  

The subway worker lay sprawled like a broken marionette, left arm twisted behind him, right fist clenched. I pried open his rigor-mortis fingers. A slip of paper—*Grand Central. Thursday, 11:15 PM. Track B-12.*  

His throat grinned sideways.  

Gin surged up my own. I retched into the coal dust.  

———  

**“I’ve been threatened by better,”** I lied.  

Fletcher’s pencil snapped. Gold whiskey trembled on his mustache. “They mentioned your uncle. Said if I didn’t bury this story, they’d send Arthur a playmate.”  

The *Star*’s newsroom buzzed behind us, telewriters clattering like distant artillery.  

“You’re off the case.” His ink-stained fingers drummed a Morse code of fear.  

I slapped the train schedule on his desk. Blood smeared the page. “Tell that to the corpse in the tunnels.”  

He didn’t look up. “Funeral’s Friday. Bring lilies.”  

———  

Rain lashed the library’s leaded windows. Eleanor Brooks emerged from the stacks, a cameo brooch pinned at her throat like a preserved scar.  

“Tunnels, you say?” She unrolled a yellowed map, her voice as dry as the parchment. “Built for coal in ’58. Retrofitted during Prohibition.” Her nail traced a spiderweb beneath Fifth Avenue. “Smugglers use them to bypass checkpoints.”  

I pointed to Delancey Street. “Where does this spur lead?”  

“Docks.” She folded the map with surgical precision. “But you didn’t hear that from me.”  

———  

My apartment reeked of betrayal. I tossed the schedule onto the desk, poured two fingers of bathtub gin, and froze.  

Shadows moved.  

“Late for a social call, isn’t it?” My Derringer found the darkness.  

Vito stepped into the jaundiced glow of my desk lamp. Rain glistened on his shoulders. “You missed the memo, doll. Warrens are Moretti turf.”  

“What’s the penalty for trespassing these days?”  

He plucked the glass from my hand, swallowed the gin in one motion. “Depends. You hoping for a spanking or a bullet?”  

Sandalwood cut through the mildew. Closer now.  

“You’re tracking mud on my last clean rug.”  

He stepped over the stain. “That corpse in the tunnels? He worked for *my* crew. You’re costing me money.”  

“Send me a bill.”  

His fingers brushed the silver streak in my hair. “Or a wreath?”  

The kiss landed like a sucker punch—hot, brutal, gone before I could bite.  

He was at the door when I threw the glass. It shattered against the jamb.  

“You taste like secrets,” he said, and vanished into the stairwell.  

———  

The train schedule glowed under my lamp. 11:15 PM. Compartment B-12.  

Arthur’s pocket watch ticked on my wrist. I lit a cigarette with hands that wouldn’t steady.  

Somewhere below, the third-floor neighbor’s radio crooned: *“…the golden chair, the golden chair, the gangster’s sweet affair…”*  

I traced the dead man’s bloodstains. Gus the night guard had mentioned strange noises in the museum basement.  

Coal chutes. Corpses. Compartments.  

The typewriter keys laughed under my fingers.
