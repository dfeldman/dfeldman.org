# Chapter 11: The Last Train  

Rain blurred the docks into a charcoal smear. I sprinted past rotting fish crates, the *Star*’s extra edition crumpled in my fist—*MAYOR FLEES!*—the ink bleeding into a Rorschach scream. Somewhere in this labyrinth of cranes and cargo holds, Enzo Moretti waited with Rosa and a loaded Colt. Somewhere, Vito walked into a trap wearing my lipstick like a war paint.  

The tunnels. They’d use the tunnels.  

I ducked into a rusted maintenance shed, kicked aside a nest of rats, and wrenched open the hatch. The coal chute swallowed me whole.  

———  

Electric bulbs buzzed in the tunnels, their jaundiced light catching the rails’ steel teeth. I followed the tracks, lungs burning, until I heard them—Rosa’s muffled sobs, Enzo’s nasal sneer.  

“Family’s a weakness, *fratello*.”  

I crouched behind a support beam. Enzo had Vito on his knees, a pistol pressed to Rosa’s temple. Her wrists were bound with piano wire, blood trickling down her fingers. Vito’s face was a mask of rage and ruin.  

“Let her go,” he growled. “The Throne’s gone. Kensington’s finished.”  

Enzo laughed. “But *you’re* not.” He gestured to a mine cart loaded with crates. “Still got one shipment to catch. Say goodbye, *innamorato*.”  

I moved.  

The derringer’s crack echoed through the tunnel. Enzo’s shoulder exploded. He reeled, firing wild. Vito tackled Rosa to the ground as bullets sparked the rails.  

“Viv!” Vito’s voice raw. “The train—!”  

I turned. Headlights speared the darkness. The art train—Kensington’s last desperate gamble—thundered toward us, its engine belching smoke. The Golden Throne glinted through a cargo door, bathed in hellfire red.  

Rosa screamed. Enzo lurched for the controls.  

———  

Chaos.  

Vito shoved Rosa into my arms. “Take her! Go!”  

“No—”  

He kissed me, hard and fleeting. “*Stop that fucking train.*”  

Enzo’s laughter chased me as I ran, Rosa’s weight sagging against my side. The tracks trembled. Twenty carriages. Ten. Five.  

I found the lever—rusted, ancient. Threw my body against it.  

The switch groaned. The train swayed. For a heartbeat, the Golden Throne hovered midair, suspended in a halo of embers. Then the world tore itself apart.  

Metal screamed. Flunes vomited fire. The throne melted into a golden scar, its rubies popping like bloodshot eyes. Enzo’s final curse dissolved in the inferno.  

———  

I found Vito in the ashes.  

He limped from the smoke, shirtless and bleeding, his skin painted in soot and blisters. Alive. *Alive.* Rosa collapsed into his arms, weeping.  

We didn’t speak. Didn’t need to. The three of us staggered into the downpour, the harbor swallowing Kensington’s empire one ember at a time.  

———  

My apartment smelled of gunpowder and wet wool. Vito stood at the window, watching dawn bruise the sky. Rosa slept on my Murphy bed, bandaged fingers curled like a child’s.  

He turned. Our eyes met.  

No more lies. No more ghosts.  

I crossed the room. He yanked me against him, his mouth hot and hungry. We fell onto the floor, a tangle of teeth and trembling flesh. His hands mapped my scars; my nails scored his back. No tenderness—just a frenzied affirmation of survival. When he finally sheathed himself inside me, we both cried out, not from pleasure, but relief. *Alive. Alive. Alive.*  

After, we lay tangled in silk sheets, the city’s sirens our lullaby. He traced my silver streak. “I’m taking Rosa to Albany. Fresh start.”  

I kissed his collarbone. “Come back.”  

He didn’t promise. But when he slipped out at dawn, he left his silver dollar on my pillow.
