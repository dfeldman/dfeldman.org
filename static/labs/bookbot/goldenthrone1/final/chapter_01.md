# Chapter 1: Empty Pedestral  

Smoke curled from my cigarette as I stared at the void where Byzantine emperors once sat. The Golden Throne’s pedestal hadn’t changed in three years—same black velvet shroud, same brass plaque tarnished by the breath of gawkers. I flicked ash onto the Kensington Museum’s marble floor. Let the docents tut.  

“Miss Sinclair.” Gus’s wheeze preceded him around the Corinthian column. His flashlight trembled in rheumatic hands. “We close in ten.”  

I didn’t turn. The dagger of his knowledge—that he’d been on duty that night too—pressed between my shoulder blades. “You ever hear anything else? About the theft?”  

His throat rattled. “Administration said not to talk.”  

“But you want to.” I caught his reflection in the glass case behind me. The dumb guilt in his bloodshot eyes.  

He shuffled closer, reeking of Ben-Gay and rye. “Basement door’s been…whispering. Last Tuesday.” A cough shook his hunched frame. “Like someone dragging chains.”  

My pulse leapt. *Uncle Arthur’s ghost,* the superstitious part of me whispered. The part that still saw his bloated face in the East River whenever I closed my eyes.  

I crushed the cigarette under my oxford. “Tell me where.”  

The grand staircase creaked. Gus melted into shadows as a pair of interns descended, their laughter too bright for the tomb-quiet halls.  

“Miss Sinclair!” Fletcher’s voice carried the edge of a man who’d shouted down riots. “My office. Now.”  

———  

The *New York Star* newsroom swam in honeyed light and sweat. Teletype machines clattered like vengeful spirits. Fletcher stood at his cracked leather desk, ink bleeding through the society page draft in his fist.  

“Beaumont’s gala.” He thrust the paper at me. “Tonight. Whitefields Estate.”  

I leaned against the doorframe. “You’re giving me glitter and hors d'oeuvres?”  

“Charles Beaumont’s importing ‘art benefactors’ from Marseille.” His index finger stabbed the guest list—a who’s who of bankers and bootleggers. “Word is the Moretti crew’s laundering through his gallery.”  

The name hit like a gut punch. *Moretti.* The same family who’d paid a certain security guard to look the other way in ’26. The guard whose body they pulled from the river six days later.  

“I need sources, not society drivel.”  

Fletcher’s laugh smelled of bourbon and bronchitis. “Kid, drivel pays your rent.” He tossed me a press pass. “Be there by eight. And Viv?” His gaze softened a fracture. “Don’t pick fights with waiters.”  

———  

My apartment greeted me with mildew and silence. I shrugged off my suspenders, the cotton sticking to my skin. The icebox yielded half a grapefruit and a bottle of Bathtub Ring gin. I drank straight from the neck.  

Three years. Three years since the headlines crucified Arthur Sinclair as the Kensington Mole. Since I’d found the farewell note hidden in my copy of *The Great Gatsby*—*They made me do it, Vivvie. Forgive me.*  

The Remington waited on the desk, its keys gleaming like rotten teeth. I fed in a fresh sheet.  

The carriage jerked.  

A slip of onionskin paper fluttered to the floor.  

Ice flooded my veins.  

*DON’T LOOK*  

The typed words blurred. I sank into the armchair, springs biting my thighs. My name curled at the bottom in familiar, spidery cursive—Arthur’s handwriting.  

But that wasn’t possible.  

The gin rose bitter in my throat as I angled the page toward the light. A single phrase glowed beneath his signature, written in lemon juice—his old trick for passing me notes during church sermons.  

*The Throne isn’t lost—it’s currency.*  

Outside, the El train screamed.
