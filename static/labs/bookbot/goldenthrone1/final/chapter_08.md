**# Chapter 8: The Forger’s Lament**  

The jazz club throbbed like a fresh bruise. Saxophone wails slithered through the sweat-slick air, tangling with the clink of ice in gin glasses. A Negro trumpeter in a moth-eaten tuxedo played a funeral dirge off-key, his notes bending under the weight of the room’s vices. We found Celeste Moreau in a back booth, her mismatched eyes glazed over a half-finished canvas. The Golden Throne glared back at us in tempura and guilt.  

“He made me sign them *Kensington*,” she slurred, swirling absinthe in a cracked coupe glass. Her brush trembled over the throne’s gilded armrest, duplicity distilled into brushstrokes. “Said forgeries fund progress. Lies fund *empires*.”  

Vito lit a cigarette, the match flaring in his cupped hands. “Where’s the ledger?”  

Celeste laughed, a sound like breaking glass. She pointed her brush at the mural behind the bar—a garish Eden where a snake coiled around the Mayor’s neck. “Check the apple.”  

The shot came as I pried the false fruit from the mural’s grasp. Plaster dust rained down as Enzo’s men kicked in the service door. Celeste stood, arms spread like a martyr, her smock blooming red. The ledger slid from her hand into the sawdust as she fell.  

“Run!” Vito tackled me behind the bar. Bullets shredded the absinthe bottles, raining emerald shards and bitter liquor. He shoved the ledger into my chest. “Stay low.”  

We crawled through a river of broken glass and blood. The trumpeter kept playing.  

—  

They chased us through Harlem’s honeycombed alleys, past fishmongers hosing off sidewalks and children dodging shadows. Vito’s grip on my wrist turned to a vise. A bullet kissed his bicep, tearing fabric and flesh. He didn’t flinch.  

“Here.” He shouldered open a flophouse door reeking of mildew and opium. Room 3B had a mattress bleeding horsehair and a sink crusted with rust. He collapsed onto the floor, rolling up his sleeve with his teeth. The wound wept crimson.  

“Let me.” I tore a strip from my slip. His skin burned under my palms.  

He watched me work, jaw tight. “You’re shaking.”  

“Adrenaline.” My fingers skimmed the scar on his jaw, the one he’d gotten at seventeen. His breath hitched.  

The ledger lay between us, its pages stained with Celeste’s final brushstrokes. Mayor Kensington’s transactions glared in indigo ink—$50,000 for a Titian forgery, $200,000 for the Throne’s replication. Vito’s free hand found my knee.  

“This ends it,” I said, more to myself than him.  

“Nothing ends.” His thumb traced my inner thigh. “Just changes hands.”  

I leaned in. His mouth was a hair’s breadth from mine when he caught my chin. “Don’t.”  

“Why?”  

“Because I’ll want more.” His gaze dropped to my split lip, the one he’d bitten in the wine cellar. “And you’re not the settling type.”  

Rain lashed the window. Somewhere below, a dog howled. I finished bandaging his arm, my knuckles brushing the coarse hair on his chest. He stood abruptly, buttoning his shirt with fumbling fingers.  

“We’ll take the ledger to Fletcher at dawn,” he said, staring at the door like it might burst open.  

“And then?”  

He pocketed the silver dollar, its surface smeared with Celeste’s blood. “Try not to get shot.”
