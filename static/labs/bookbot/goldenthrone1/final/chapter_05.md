**# Chapter 5: Compartment B-12**  

The train groaned like a dying beast as we slipped past the tenements of Queens. Vito’s shoulder pressed against mine in the narrow compartment, our breaths fogging the window. Outside, the moonlit marshes blurred into a smear of oil and shadows. He’d traded his tuxedo for a rumpled newsboy’s cap and workman’s denim, but the sandalwood scent still clung to him—a dissonant note in the stench of coal smoke and stale sweat.  

“You’re staring, doll.” He didn’t look up from cleaning his switchblade. The steel caught the overhead bulb’s jaundiced light.  

“Admiring your restraint. I expected more complaining about riding coach.” I adjusted the kerchief hiding my hair. The stolen porter’s uniform chafed at my thighs.  

“Sweetheart, I grew up hauling fish on the Fulton line. This?” His blade snapped shut. “This is the Ritz.”  

The key burned against my breastbone, strung on a chain with my mother’s locket. *B-12.* Freddie’s drunken sneer flashed in my memory—*corpses built those rails.* The conductor’s voice barked down the corridor. “Glen Cove, next stop! Glen Cove!”  

Vito rose, the muscles in his back flexing under thin cotton. “Clock’s ticking.”  

The first-class car loomed ahead, its mahogany paneling and stained glass doors a mockery of the cattle-car stench we’d escaped. I pressed against the shuddering wall as a white-jacketed steward passed, his tray of champagne flutes trembling. Vito’s hand closed over mine.  

“Wrong move, detective.” His thumb traced the notch in my palm where the Derringer’s grip had worn a callus. “Nerves?”  

I jerked free. “Anticipation. Ever stabbed a man in a smoking jacket?”  

Compartment B-12’s lock clicked like a broken jaw. The air inside was tomb-cold, stale with the reek of Cuban cigars and betrayal. Velvet drapes choked the windows. Vito struck a match, the flare illuminating crates stamped *FRAGILE—MUSEUM TRANSPORT.*  

“Jackpot,” I whispered.  

He pried open a lid. Rembrandt’s *Storm on the Sea of Galilee* stared up at us, the apostles’ faces warped in a forger’s imperfect hand. “Kensington’s been busy.”  

I sifted through shipping manifests. “Boston, Philly, Chicago… He’s replacing every stolen piece with fakes.” A love letter fluttered to the floor, the mayor’s crest embossed on creamy stationery.  

*My dearest Celeste—*  

Vito snatched it up. “Christ. The mistress has better penmanship than my sister’s priest.”  

A floorboard creaked in the corridor. We froze. Inspector Burns’ Scottish brogue sliced through the door. “—absurd notion, but His Honor insists we check every compartment—”  

Vito killed the match. Darkness swallowed us whole. His hand found my waist, yanking me into the slender gap between a crate and the wall. My back pressed against his chest, his heartbeat a frantic counter-rhythm to the clattering rails.  

The doorknob turned.  

“Easy,” he breathed into my hair. His palm slid over my mouth. I bit down hard enough to taste copper.  

Burns’ flashlight beam swept the crates. “Bloody waste of time,” he muttered. The door sighed shut.  

Vito released me. “You fight like a feral cat.”  

“You smell like a distillery.” I wiped his blood from my lips. “We need those letters.”  

“We need to *survive.*” He gripped my wrist as I reached for the crate. “Kensington’s got half the force on his payroll. You think Burns won’t put a bullet in your spine for a pension boost?”  

The train lurched. My uncle’s suicide note crinkled in my brassiere—*Forgive me, Viv. The truth is uglier than you know.* I’d carried it for three years, its edges fraying like my resolve.  

“My uncle wrote that he failed.” The words tasted of gin and grave dirt. “But he didn’t. He found the ledger, the shipping routes. They drove a bullet through his reputation instead of his skull.”  

Vito stilled. Outside, a crossing bell clanged.  

“You want confession?” His laugh was bitter as burnt coffee. “I drive trucks full of morphine to Hell’s Kitchen clinics. Take cut from widows’ rent money. Last month, I broke a dockworker’s knees for skimming $10.” He caught my chin, forcing my gaze. “But every cent goes to Rosa’s design school fund. Every. Damn. Cent.”  

The raw edge in his voice undid me. I reached up, straightening his crooked tie. “You’re a terrible liar, Romano.”  

His hand trapped mine against his chest. “And you’re a worse judge of character, Sinclair.”  

The train shrieked into a tunnel. Blackness swallowed us. His lips grazed my cheekbone, then the corner of my mouth—a question, not a demand. The crate shifted.  

We fell.  

He twisted mid-air, taking the brunt of the impact. My hips slotted against his as we sprawled across cold hardwood. His thumb brushed the silver streak in my hair. “Still playing hero?” I rasped.  

“Still dodging answers?”  

The train erupted into light. We froze—my palms on his shoulders, his fingers digging into my hips. Somewhere, a child laughed. A woman’s stockinged leg brushed our compartment door.  

Vito’s grin was all teeth. “You gonna kiss me or solve the case, detective?”  

The brakes screamed. Glass shattered. A fist pounded the door. “Police! Open up!”  

He rolled us sideways as bullets splintered the wood. “Time to go.”  

We leapt onto the coupling platform, wind clawing at our clothes. The marsh stretched below, hungry and endless. Vito’s hand found mine.  

“Jump when I say!”  

“Go to hell!”  

“Already on fire, doll.” He pulled me against him. “Now.”  

We fell through smoke and stars, the tracks rising to meet us.
