Neon signs flicker above pawnshops; headlines scream about gangland shootings and soaring stocks.  \n- **Tension**: The humidity feels like a held breath. Every interaction carries subtext\u2014flirtation laced with danger, offers of help that could be traps.  \n- **Eroticism**: Lingering touches in crowded speakeasies, the slide of silk stockings, whispered secrets in dark corners.

I spread them across Fletcher\u2019s desk beneath the newsroom\u2019s jaundiced light, the Mayor\u2019s forged invoices overlapping with mugshots of dead informants. \u201cKensington\u2019s been funneling city funds through the museum\u2019s restoration fund,\u201d I said, tracing a column of numbers with my chewed nail. \u201cEvery \u2018donation\u2019 paid for another forgery. Every forgery bought another councilman.\u201d  \n\nFletcher didn\u2019t look up from his typewriter. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d  \n\n\u201cVito took a bullet.\u201d  \n\nHis fingers froze mid-sentence. The *Star*\u2019s presses groaned below us like a living thing. \u201cHow bad?\u201d  \n\n\u201cFlesh wound. He\u2019s at Delgado\u2019s getting stitched with gin and a dirty needle.\u201d I jabbed at a ledger entry dated June 12th. \u201cThis is the proof. Kensington ordered the Golden Throne heist to replace it with a fake. My uncle caught them mid-swap\u2014\u201d  \n\n\u201cAnd they framed him.\u201d Fletcher finally met my gaze, his bifocals reflecting the single dangling bulb. \u201cI know.\u201d  \n\nIce slid down my spine. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \n\nHe opened his top drawer. A cameo brooch gleamed against the felt lining\u2014Eleanor Brooks\u2019 brooch. The one she\u2019d worn when helping me map the tunnels. \u201cShe came by last night,\u201d he said, voice graveled with something worse than anger. \u201cTold me to burn your notes unless I wanted Sammy\u2019s nieces to wind up in the East River.\u201d  \n\nThe newsroom tilted. I gripped the desk edge. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d  \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s Kensington\u2019s eyes in the stacks,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cHas been since \u201924.\u201d He tossed a surveillance photo onto the ledger\u2014Eleanor in a cloche hat, handing an envelope to a man in a councilman\u2019s pin-striped suit. \u201cFollow the money, Viv. It always leads back to someone you\u2014\u201d  \n\nI was already running. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nThe tunnels breathed. Damp air hissed through cracks in the brickwork as I followed Eleanor\u2019s trail of lavender perfume. My flashlight beam carved shaky circles through the gloom. She\u2019d left a breadcrumb trail even a child could follow\u2014a hairpin at the coal chute entrance, a glove by the junction where tracks branched toward the docks. \u201cI know you\u2019re there, Vivian.\u201d Her voice echoed off the curved walls. I rounded a corner to find her standing before a rusted vault door, the cameo brooch winking at her throat. \u201cSuch a shame. You had the makings of a decent researcher.\u201d  \n\nI leveled my Derringer. \u201cWas it the money? Or did Kensington promise to stock your precious library with first editions?\u201d  \n\n\u201cHe promised not to burn it down.\u201d She pressed a palm to the vault wheel. \u201cThe Throne\u2019s inside. Along with some... personal effects.\u201d  \n\nThe door screeched open. Gold gleamed in the darkness\u2014the Byzantine throne, its garnet eyes judging me from the shadows. But it was the object on the seat that stole my breath: Uncle Arthur\u2019s pocket watch, its cracked face frozen at 2:17 AM. The hour he\u2019d jumped. \u201cThey let him keep it when they fired him,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cA kindness, I thought.\u201d  \n\nMy finger tightened on the trigger. \u201cYou helped them destroy him.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI preserved history.\u201d She stepped closer, perfume cloying as embalming fluid. \u201cEvery empire needs martyrs. Every martyr needs a\u2014\u201d  \n\nThe shot rang out before I realized I\u2019d fired. Eleanor staggered, clutching her shoulder. Blood seeped through her cardigan as she laughed. \u201cOh, *cherie*. You still think bullets solve anything.\u201d  \n\nShe yanked a rusted lever. The world exploded. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nBrick dust rained from the ceiling as the tunnel convulsed. I lunged for the Throne, grabbing the pocket watch as beams splintered around us. Eleanor sprinted toward a mine cart parked on the tracks, her gray bun unraveling. \u201cVivian!\u201d  \n\nVito\u2019s voice cut through the cacophony. He leapt over a collapsing support beam, face streaked with soot and fury. \u201cThe whole sector\u2019s coming down!\u201d  \n\nI tackled Eleanor as she tried to climb into the cart. We hit the tracks hard, her nails raking my cheek. The Throne toppled, one golden arm snapping off as a beam crushed it. \u201cLet go, you stupid girl!\u201d Eleanor clawed at my hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to run.\u201d I twisted, pinning her beneath me as the ceiling buckled. \u201cNot from this.\u201d  \n\nVito hauled us both into the cart. The tracks screamed beneath us as he cranked the acceleration lever. We hurtled into darkness just as the vault collapsed, the Throne\u2019s final scream of twisting metal swallowed by the void. \u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nSilence. The cart ground to a halt in a pocket of untouched tunnel. Water dripped. Someone moaned. Me.  \n\nVito\u2019s arms locked around me, our breath mingling in the scant inch between lips. Blood trickled from his temple. I didn\u2019t remember grabbing his lapels. \u201cStill alive?\u201d he rasped. \u201cDisappointed?\u201d  \n\nHis laugh vibrated through me. \u201cYou wish.\u201d  \n\nEleanor stirred at our feet, cursing in Italian. Vito pressed his forehead to mine, his pulse wild against my skin. For one reckless moment, I thought he\u2019d kiss me\u2014or I\u2019d kiss him. Then the flashlight flickered, revealing the carnage around us. The Throne was gone. But in my palm, the pocket watch ticked.\n\nWrite the chapter in engaging prose. End with \"THE END\".",
    "content": "# Chapter 10: A Throne of Lies  \n\nCity Hall\u2019s marble corridors smelled of lemon polish and lies. My heels clicked a war drum rhythm as I stormed toward the Mayor\u2019s office, Vito\u2019s footsteps a shadow behind me. The pocket watch burned through my coat pocket, its resurrected ticking a metronome of rage. *Two-fucking-seventeen AM.*  \n\nKensington\u2019s secretary lunged from her desk, pearls swinging. \u201cMiss Sinclair, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d  \n\nI kicked the oak door open.  \n\nMayor Harold Kensington stood framed by Fifth Avenue\u2019s skyline, pouring brandy into crystal glasses like he\u2019d been expecting us. \u201cVivian. Mr. Romano.\u201d He gestured to the leather chairs. \u201cDrink? It\u2019s a \u201917 Armagnac.\u201d  \n\nVito\u2019s hand flexed near his holster. \u201cWhere\u2019s Enzo?\u201d  \n\n\u201cChasing greener pastures, I\u2019m told.\u201d The Mayor sipped his brandy, gaze sliding to me. \u201cYou look well, considering the tunnels\u2019\u2026 instability.\u201d  \n\nI slammed the pocket watch on his desk. The cracked face glared up at him. \u201cConfess. Or I\u2019ll print how you turned the Kensington into a laundromat for murderers.\u201d  \n\nHe smiled\u2014slow, reptilian. \u201cYou think truth matters here?\u201d A painting swung open behind him, revealing a steel vault. Inside, stacked canvases gleamed: Van Goghs, Rembrandts, all stamped *Art Preservation LLC*. \u201cThe *real* currency, Miss Sinclair. Not gold. Not guns. *Perception.*\u201d  \n\nVito stepped closer. \u201cYou framed her uncle. Strung up a dead man to hide your shit.\u201d  \n\n\u201cArthur Sinclair was a means to an end.\u201d Kensington refilled his glass, the brandy catching fire in the afternoon light. \u201cMen like him exist to be spent. As do you.\u201d  \n\nI lunged across the desk, gripping his silk tie. His breath soured with decay. \u201cYou\u2019re finished. Fletcher\u2019s running the story tonight.\u201d  \n\nHe laughed. \u201cAnd who\u2019ll believe a morphine-addled hack and a gangster\u2019s whore?\u201d  \n\nVito\u2019s fist connected with his jaw. The Mayor sprawled against the vault, blood threading his silver stubble. \u201cYou forgot \u2018pissed-off,\u2019\u201d Vito growled.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nThe *Star*\u2019s presses roared like caged beasts. Fletcher fed them my article page by page, the headlines screaming: *MAYOR\u2019S ART SCHEME EXPOSED!* *GOLDEN THRONE HEIST SOLVED!* I watched through the newsroom window, inky fingerprints staining the glass. *Uncle Arthur\u2019s name cleared.* The thought should\u2019ve tasted sweet. It felt like ash.  \n\nVito leaned against the doorframe, silhouette carved from shadow. \u201cThey\u2019ll arrest him?\u201d  \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll try.\u201d Fletcher wiped his hands on a rag, the presses shaking the floor beneath us. \u201cBut men like Kensington\u2026 they\u2019ve always got a rat hole.\u201d  \n\nA copyboy sprinted in, face flushed. \u201cBoss! Cops just found his car abandoned near the docks. Empty.\u201d  \n\nThe victory curdled.  \n\nVito\u2019s phone rang. He paled, fingers whitening around the receiver. \u201c*Rosa?*\u201d  \n\nSilence. Then a voice slick as oil: \u201cYou owe me a throne, *fratello*.\u201d Enzo.  \n\nVito\u2019s gun hit the floor.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nRain sheeted against the *Star*\u2019s windows as Vito paced, a caged animal in a ruined suit. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill her,\u201d he said for the tenth time.  \n\nI gripped his shoulders, forcing him still. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her.\u201d  \n\nHe laughed\u2014a raw, shattered sound. \u201cYou don\u2019t find Enzo. He finds you.\u201d His hands rose to frame my face, callouses catching on my jaw. \u201cTake her. If I don\u2019t come back. Take her somewhere with\u2026 with trees.\u201d  \n\n\u201cVito\u2014\u201d  \n\nHis mouth crushed mine.  \n\nThe kiss tasted of blood and ink and reckless want, his fingers threading through my hair as the presses thundered below. I bit his lip, scoring vengeance and promise into flesh. He groaned, pulling me flush against him until the Derringer dug into my ribs.  \n\nFletcher cleared his throat.  \n\nWe broke apart, breath ragged. Vito pressed his forehead to mine, eyes closed. \u201cKeep her safe,\u201d he whispered.  \n\nThen he was gone, swallowed by the storm."
