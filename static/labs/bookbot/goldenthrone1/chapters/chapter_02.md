# Chapter 2: Whiskey and Razorblades  

The Oasis stank of bad decisions. I ducked through the butcher shop’s hanging beef carcasses, their bloody hooks glinting like accusation fingers. A false wall groaned open behind the liverwurst display. Blue smoke slapped me first—cheap cigars and the sweet rot of bootleg gin. Then came the sawdust tang of spilled blood.  

Rex Donovan sat in the back booth, nursing rye from a jar labeled *Pig’s Feet*. His shoulders swallowed the space, a mountain gone to seed. He didn’t look up as I slid in. “You’re late.”  

“And you’re a cliché.” I snatched his drink, the liquor burning like a struck match. “What’s so urgent a girl has to skip her beauty sleep?”  

His thumb jabbed toward the bar. Sammy Delgado polished glasses with a rag that’d never seen soap. The serpent tattoo on his neck rippled. “Your new boyfriend’s been nosing around all week,” Rex grunted. “Asking who runs the art beat at the *Star*.”  

**“Who** asked?”  

Rex’s flask sneaked from his coat. I caught the glint of nickel plating. “Some greaseball in a sharkskin suit. Enzo Moretti’s favorite lapdog.” He tossed a matchbook onto the table. Waterfront address scribbled on the back. “Delancey Street. It’s a knife magnet.”  

I pocketed the matches. “Come with me. Split the scoop.”  

“I don’t file reports for Fletcher’s fishwrap.” His laugh rattled loose change. “You been tailed?”  

“Only by ghosts.”  

He leaned in. Whiskey and Sen-Sen overwhelmed the speakeasy stench. “Your uncle wasn’t no thief, Viv. But digging up that coffin gets you two things—a bullet or a body bag.”  

The door to the butcher shop creaked open. Cold air razored through the haze. Rex stiffened. “Back exit. Now.”  

———  

Rain needled my neck as I stumbled into the alley. Garbage festered in puddles. My fingers found the Derringer in my garter just as a voice purred through the downpour. “Running from shadows, doll?”  

Vito Romano leaned against a brick wall, flicking a silver dollar across his knuckles. His suit clung too well, sharp enough to draw blood. I stepped back. “Who’s paying you to lurk in the dark? Moretti?”  

The coin froze midair. “You say his name like it’s a curse. Could be we’re on the same side.”  

“Do thieves have sides now?”  

His laugh hummed against wet skin. “We’ve got better wardrobes than cops.” He pushed off the wall. Rain sluiced down his jaw. My throat tightened.  

“Let’s trade.” He blocked my path. Heat radiated through his soaked shirt. “You tell me why Kensington’s pet project died with your uncle. I tell you why his corpse floats in every speakeasy confession.”  

I spat at his wingtip. “Only corpse here’s yours if you don’t move.”  

He reached for my collar. Calluses snagged the silk. “You’ve got—” His thumb brushed my pulse point. “Lint.”  

The slap echoed. His head snapped sideways, but the grin stayed. “Attagirl.”  

We stood chest to chest, breath tangling. His sandalwood cologne warred with the alley’s decay. Thunder cannonballed overhead. He pressed the silver dollar into my palm. “For the subway, *principessa*. Looks like you’ll need it.”  

———  

My drenched clothes clung like a second skin. Rex’s matchbook dissolved in my hand as I stared at the boarded-up tenement. The Delancey Street address bled ink. Above me, a gargoyle vomited rainwater.  

Inside my apartment, I peeled off my stockings. The telegram slithered from my coat pocket.  

*Dear Miss Sinclair—*  
*Urban Renewal Comm. records enclosed. Follow the tracks.*  
*—A Friend*  

The ledger page fluttered to the floor—seven grand diverted from “Public Works” to “Art Preservation LLC” last month. Serial numbers from Kensington’s vault.  

I poured a bath of gin. Drank half. The other half stung my split knuckles. Through the steam, Vito’s smirk haunted the mirror.  

*Currency.*  

Arthur’s lemon-juice ghost whispered as I sank beneath the surface.
