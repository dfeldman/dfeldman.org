# Chapter 10: A Throne of Lies  

City Hall’s marble corridors smelled of lemon polish and lies. My heels clicked a war drum rhythm as I stormed toward the Mayor’s office, Vito’s footsteps a shadow behind me. The pocket watch burned through my coat pocket, its resurrected ticking a metronome of rage. *Two-fucking-seventeen AM.*  

Kensington’s secretary lunged from her desk, pearls swinging. “Miss Sinclair, you can’t—”  

I kicked the oak door open.  

Mayor Harold Kensington stood framed by Fifth Avenue’s skyline, pouring brandy into crystal glasses like he’d been expecting us. “Vivian. Mr. Romano.” He gestured to the leather chairs. “Drink? It’s a ’17 Armagnac.”  

Vito’s hand flexed near his holster. “Where’s Enzo?”  

“Chasing greener pastures, I’m told.” The Mayor sipped his brandy, gaze sliding to me. “You look well, considering the tunnels’… instability.”  

I slammed the pocket watch on his desk. The cracked face glared up at him. “Confess. Or I’ll print how you turned the Kensington into a laundromat for murderers.”  

He smiled—slow, reptilian. “You think truth matters here?” A painting swung open behind him, revealing a steel vault. Inside, stacked canvases gleamed: Van Goghs, Rembrandts, all stamped *Art Preservation LLC*. “The *real* currency, Miss Sinclair. Not gold. Not guns. *Perception.*”  

Vito stepped closer. “You framed her uncle. Strung up a dead man to hide your shit.”  

“Arthur Sinclair was a means to an end.” Kensington refilled his glass, the brandy catching fire in the afternoon light. “Men like him exist to be spent. As do you.”  

I lunged across the desk, gripping his silk tie. His breath soured with decay. “You’re finished. Fletcher’s running the story tonight.”  

He laughed. “And who’ll believe a morphine-addled hack and a gangster’s whore?”  

Vito’s fist connected with his jaw. The Mayor sprawled against the vault, blood threading his silver stubble. “You forgot ‘pissed-off,’” Vito growled.  

———  

The *Star*’s presses roared like caged beasts. Fletcher fed them my article page by page, the headlines screaming: *MAYOR’S ART SCHEME EXPOSED!* *GOLDEN THRONE HEIST SOLVED!* I watched through the newsroom window, inky fingerprints staining the glass. *Uncle Arthur’s name cleared.* The thought should’ve tasted sweet. It felt like ash.  

Vito leaned against the doorframe, silhouette carved from shadow. “They’ll arrest him?”  

“They’ll try.” Fletcher wiped his hands on a rag, the presses shaking the floor beneath us. “But men like Kensington… they’ve always got a rat hole.”  

A copyboy sprinted in, face flushed. “Boss! Cops just found his car abandoned near the docks. Empty.”  

The victory curdled.  

Vito’s phone rang. He paled, fingers whitening around the receiver. “*Rosa?*”  

Silence. Then a voice slick as oil: “You owe me a throne, *fratello*.” Enzo.  

Vito’s gun hit the floor.  

———  

Rain sheeted against the *Star*’s windows as Vito paced, a caged animal in a ruined suit. “He’ll kill her,” he said for the tenth time.  

I gripped his shoulders, forcing him still. “We’ll find her.”  

He laughed—a raw, shattered sound. “You don’t find Enzo. He finds you.” His hands rose to frame my face, callouses catching on my jaw. “Take her. If I don’t come back. Take her somewhere with… with trees.”  

“Vito—”  

His mouth crushed mine.  

The kiss tasted of blood and ink and reckless want, his fingers threading through my hair as the presses thundered below. I bit his lip, scoring vengeance and promise into flesh. He groaned, pulling me flush against him until the Derringer dug into my ribs.  

Fletcher cleared his throat.  

We broke apart, breath ragged. Vito pressed his forehead to mine, eyes closed. “Keep her safe,” he whispered.  

Then he was gone, swallowed by the storm.
