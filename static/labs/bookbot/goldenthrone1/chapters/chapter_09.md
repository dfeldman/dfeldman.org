# Chapter 9: The Mole in the Mirror  

The stench of mildew clung to the ledger pages like a guilty secret. I spread them across Fletcher’s desk beneath the newsroom’s jaundiced light, the Mayor’s forged invoices overlapping with mugshots of dead informants. “Kensington’s been funneling city funds through the museum’s restoration fund,” I said, tracing a column of numbers with my chewed nail. “Every ‘donation’ paid for another forgery. Every forgery bought another councilman.”  

Fletcher didn’t look up from his typewriter. “You’re late.”  

“Vito took a bullet.”  

His fingers froze mid-sentence. The *Star*’s presses groaned below us like a living thing. “How bad?”  

“Flesh wound. He’s at Delgado’s getting stitched with gin and a dirty needle.” I jabbed at a ledger entry dated June 12th. “This is the proof. Kensington ordered the Golden Throne heist to replace it with a fake. My uncle caught them mid-swap—”  

“And they framed him.” Fletcher finally met my gaze, his bifocals reflecting the single dangling bulb. “I know.”  

Ice slid down my spine. “What?”  

He opened his top drawer. A cameo brooch gleamed against the felt lining—Eleanor Brooks’ brooch. The one she’d worn when helping me map the tunnels. “She came by last night,” he said, voice graveled with something worse than anger. “Told me to burn your notes unless I wanted Sammy’s nieces to wind up in the East River.”  

The newsroom tilted. I gripped the desk edge. “You’re lying.”  

“She’s Kensington’s eyes in the stacks,” Fletcher said. “Has been since ’24.” He tossed a surveillance photo onto the ledger—Eleanor in a cloche hat, handing an envelope to a man in a councilman’s pin-striped suit. “Follow the money, Viv. It always leads back to someone you—”  

I was already running.  

———  

The tunnels breathed.  

Damp air hissed through cracks in the brickwork as I followed Eleanor’s trail of lavender perfume. My flashlight beam carved shaky circles through the gloom. She’d left a breadcrumb trail even a child could follow—a hairpin at the coal chute entrance, a glove by the junction where tracks branched toward the docks.  

“I know you’re there, Vivian.” Her voice echoed off the curved walls. I rounded a corner to find her standing before a rusted vault door, the cameo brooch winking at her throat. “Such a shame. You had the makings of a decent researcher.”  

I leveled my Derringer. “Was it the money? Or did Kensington promise to stock your precious library with first editions?”  

“He promised not to burn it down.” She pressed a palm to the vault wheel. “The Throne’s inside. Along with some... personal effects.”  

The door screeched open. Gold gleamed in the darkness—the Byzantine throne, its garnet eyes judging me from the shadows. But it was the object on the seat that stole my breath: Uncle Arthur’s pocket watch, its cracked face frozen at 2:17 AM. The hour he’d jumped.  

“They let him keep it when they fired him,” Eleanor said. “A kindness, I thought.”  

My finger tightened on the trigger. “You helped them destroy him.”  

“I preserved history.” She stepped closer, perfume cloying as embalming fluid. “Every empire needs martyrs. Every martyr needs a—”  

The shot rang out before I realized I’d fired.  

Eleanor staggered, clutching her shoulder. Blood seeped through her cardigan as she laughed. “Oh, *cherie*. You still think bullets solve anything.”  

She yanked a rusted lever.  

The world exploded.  

———  

Brick dust rained from the ceiling as the tunnel convulsed. I lunged for the Throne, grabbing the pocket watch as beams splintered around us. Eleanor sprinted toward a mine cart parked on the tracks, her gray bun unraveling.  

“Vivian!”  

Vito’s voice cut through the cacophony. He leapt over a collapsing support beam, face streaked with soot and fury. “The whole sector’s coming down!”  

I tackled Eleanor as she tried to climb into the cart. We hit the tracks hard, her nails raking my cheek. The Throne toppled, one golden arm snapping off as a beam crushed it.  

“Let go, you stupid girl!” Eleanor clawed at my hands.  

“You don’t get to run.” I twisted, pinning her beneath me as the ceiling buckled. “Not from this.”  

Vito hauled us both into the cart. The tracks screamed beneath us as he cranked the acceleration lever. We hurtled into darkness just as the vault collapsed, the Throne’s final scream of twisting metal swallowed by the void.  

———  

Silence.  

The cart ground to a halt in a pocket of untouched tunnel. Water dripped. Someone moaned. Me.  

Vito’s arms locked around me, our breath mingling in the scant inch between lips. Blood trickled from his temple. I didn’t remember grabbing his lapels.  

“Still alive?” he rasped.  

“Disappointed?”  

His laugh vibrated through me. “You wish.”  

Eleanor stirred at our feet, cursing in Italian. Vito pressed his forehead to mine, his pulse wild against my skin. For one reckless moment, I thought he’d kiss me—or I’d kiss him. Then the flashlight flickered, revealing the carnage around us.  

The Throne was gone.  

But in my palm, the pocket watch ticked.
