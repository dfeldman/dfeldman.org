## The Top 10 Security Sesssions from KubeCon North America 2024

KubeCon is by far the biggest open-source cloud computing conference. While it's not a security conference, many of the most interesting security engineering projects in the tech industry participate. And often, they even time big announcements to coincide with KubeCon! 

Here are the top 10 sessions from KubeCon North America 2024 that I think every security practitioner should take a few minutes to watch. All the links go into my own KubeCon Content Browser which shows the video, slides and notes together. Sometimes it's faster to browse through the slides and notes than to watch the entire video. 

I've tried to avoid talks focusing on one vendor or project, and instead showcase case studies and big ideas.

Disclaimer: I only reviewed sessions that had video available on November 16, but it can take up to a few weeks to post all the videos. So I may have missed a few great sessions.

### 1. Authentication and Authorization (AuthN/AuthZ)

#### [**Bridging Clouds: TikTok’s Blueprint for Unified OIDC Access on Multi-Cloud Kubernetes**](https://dfeldman.org/labs/kubecon_browser/kcna2024/#1i7lM)
- **Speaker**: Naveen Mogulla
- **Why It Matters**: Everyone knows TikTok! And of course with hundreds of millions of users, they have a vast Kubernetes infrastructure - over 250 large clusters around the world, in many different cloud providers. In this session, Naveen shows how they connect to all these clouds with a custom-made OIDC solution. 

#### **Workload Identity Federation – Stop Using Long-Lived Credentials**
- **Speakers**: Anjali Telang, Benjamin Dronen
- **Why It Matters**: 

### 2. Network Security

### 3. Supply Chain Security
