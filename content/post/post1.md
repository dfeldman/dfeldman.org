{{< marginnote "This margin note introduces the post and highlights its comprehensive nature." >}}
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on Hugo features. This post will demonstrate various Hugo capabilities, including margin notes, table of contents, and more.
{{< /marginnote >}}

## Introduction

Hugo is a powerful static site generator that offers a wide range of features for creating robust and efficient websites. In this post, we'll explore some of its key capabilities.

## Table of Contents

Hugo automatically generates a table of contents for us, which you can see at the top of this post.

## Markdown Formatting

### Text Styling

{{< marginnote "Markdown makes text formatting intuitive and straightforward." >}}
Hugo uses Markdown for content creation, which allows for easy text formatting.
{{< /marginnote >}}

You can create **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~ text easily. You can also create [links](https://gohugo.io) to other resources.

### Lists

Here's an example of an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Blockquotes

{{< marginnote "Blockquotes are great for highlighting important statements or quotes from others." >}}
Blockquotes can be used to highlight important information or to quote external sources.

Here's an example of a blockquote:

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

## Code Blocks

Hugo supports syntax highlighting for code blocks. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Hugo User"))
```

## Images

{{< marginnote "Images can greatly enhance your content and make it more engaging." >}}
Hugo makes it easy to include images in your posts. You can add captions and alt text for better accessibility.

## Advanced Features

### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes allow you to add complex features with simple syntax. We've been using the `marginnote` shortcode throughout this post.

### Custom Layouts

While not visible in the Markdown, this post is using a custom layout that includes margin notes and a responsive design.
