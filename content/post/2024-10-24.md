## The Solutions Architect Professional certification: Why bother?

Amazon Web Services dominates cloud computing today. When I work with large tech-first companies, the question isn't whether they use AWS; it's whether they use anything else, or rely on AWS completely. AWS is what Microsoft was in the 90's. 

That means when I'm planning out security solutions with customers, they'll use AWS terminology, concepts and practices. AWS is the lingua franca. Even if you're building on Azure, GCP, or on-prem, the building blocks are going to be isomorphic to AWS services. 

For that reason alone, it's important for everyone who wants to be a technical leader in IT or cloud engineering to have a solid background in AWS. You could do it by studying on your own, but the certificate gives you a concrete goal to study for and a little proof of your expertise at the end. So why not do it?

Out of all the AWS certificates, I chose the Solutions Architect Professional certificate because I like a challenge. It's probably not necessary to have knowledge this in-depth unless you're running an entire development team. But since I am trying to design large-scale solutions for multiple companies at the same time, I thought it would be the right choice for me. 

The Solutions Architect Associate certificate covers the same content, but is much less in depth. I would recommend that one for most people.

## The Challenge
This certificate is extraordinarily challenging. AWS recommends two years of experience as a lead cloud architect before even taking the exam. 
It covers all areas of AWS, including networking, security, storage, compute, serverless, and the added-value services that AWS has built on top. 

I had some experience with AWS from my previous work. I actually built my first static site on S3 back in 2009! And I worked on a project to build an S3-based backup solution
starting in 2011, and built a web app on EC2 in 2016. Over the years I've logged into the S3 and EC2 consoles hundreds of times. 
But I also had never really branched out from there into how to administer a production-grade service on AWS. Everywhere I've worked, that had been the responsibility of a separate DevOps or SRE team. So while I knew most of the concepts, I had nowhere near the depth of knowledge required to pass the test. 

## The Process
I used three primary resources to study for the exam: 

1. AWS Documentation. Of course this is the most important part. The documentation is well-written and even calls out potential "gotcha" questions. But there is far too much documentation to read all of it, so you have to be selective. 
1. ACloudGuru's courses. I watched all the videos for the associate-level and professional-level exams. They are roughly 30 hours of content, combined, and include practice exams and hands-on labs.
1. Adrian Cantrill's course. This one is about 70 hours. It also includes a few practice exams. 

Overall, I found ACloudGuru to be the best for practice exams and labs, while Adrian Cantrill had far better lectures that go into much more detail. I'd recommend both resources.

I always find it extremely hard to pay full attention to pre-recorded online lectures. I recommend going at 2x speed, and then slowing down when you don't understand something. Even so, a lot of my "watching" was while doing chores, walking my dog, or unrelated work. I took a few notes when something really stood out to me, but I didn't take rigorous notes. (Perhaps I should have.)

### Flash cards? 
I actually made my own spaced-repetition flash card app called CertCards when I started studying for the exam. As it's not very functional, I didn't really use it all that much. Nonetheless, I'm hoping to polish the app and release it in the future. 

## What to study

### History and context
A bit of history. It's important to know that S3, EC2, and SQS were the original three services, and EBS, IAM and VPCs were bolted on later. Then other services came after that. This helps you explain why S3 has its own permissions mechanism separate from IAM, or why not all instances have EBS volumes.

Also there have been many high-profile breaches caused by insufficient S3 access permissions. Hence the multiple attempts at adding better security to S3. 

AWS initially used Xen virtualization under the hood, but switched completely to their own hypervisor called Nitro in around 2016 which may be based on KVM (I'm not certain). 
That explains a bit about why there are different AMIs that support each. 

AWS used to let instances access their own metadata through a very simple service called IMDS. After a high profile breach, they updated to IMDSv2, which is more secure - but IMDS is still available by default. 

For most of AWS history, you had to SSH into an instance directly. A whole universe of products called "privileged access management" cropped up to restrict and monitor users SSHing into instances. AWS didn't develop just one alternative -- they now have *two*, Instance Connect and Systems Manager Session Manager (say that one ten times fast). 

{{< marginnote "AWS is on its own here. The other clouds used OIDC from the start." >}}
Also, for most of AWS history, users had fixed static Access Keys and Secret Access Keys. AWS is really trying to get away from that, with multiple different ways to get temporary Access Keys and Secret Access Keys.

   1. API Gateway
      1. REST mode understands requests and provides more detailed functionality (doesn't actually HAVE to be REST)
      1. Non-REST mode just uses HTTP
   1. VPC Lattice
      1. This is not actually on the test yet, but it seems to be AWS' big networking thing, so it probably will be soon.

       1. Snapshots
       1. RAID arrays of EBS volumes and when to use
   1. S3
       1. S3 is the core storage service for AWS. Almost everything depends on it. This is because it predates the other storage and database services. 
       1. S3 gateways in the VPC

        1. Lambda objects
        1. Triggering events from S3 actions (both within S3, and also CloudWatch Events)
   1. S3 Express One Zone
       1. This is a very different service that happens to be under the S3 brand name. It has totally different semantics from S3.
       1. In my opinion, it shouldn't even be called S3. 
       1. Amazon, please fix this.
   1. EFS
       1. Use on Linux and Windows
       1. Transit encryption -- this actually just uses stunnel at the application layer!
       1. Pricing (this one's expensive)
   1. Snowball Edge
       1. This started as a storage device, but now has a lot of compute capabilities too.

### Databases
 1. Aurora & RDS
1. Data migration
1. Schema migration
1. Supported databases
    1. MySQL
    1. Postgres
    1. SQL Server
    1. Oracle (it works a bit differently)
    1. DB2 (also a bit odd)
    1. Gaps in functionality between these, e.g. a good deal of stuff is not available on DB2
    1. BabelFish
1. Replication and promotion
1. Maintenance windows
1. Backup RTO and RPO
1. Aurora
    1. Despite the marketing, Aurora is basically RDS with an improved storage layer.

1. DynamoDB
    1. Performance quotas 
1. Read the Dynamo paper! 
1. Partition and sort keys

1. Managed ElasticSearch
1. Caches:
   1. Managed Memcached
   1. Managed Redis/Valkey
   1. You really always want to be using Redis/Valkey. Memcached is usually a red herring.

### Security
   1. Accounts, users, and organizations
   1. ARN format 
   1. IAM
      1. IAM is a huge topic on its own. You could write MANY books about IAM. This is the largest single study area. Truly mastering IAM would probably take years of study. Be forewarned!
      1. Need to be able to write and read IAM policies fluently. 
      1. Understand resource and user policies
      1. Understand roles
      1. Understand using roles across accounts
      1. IAM Federation using SAML and OIDC

      1. Auditing and checking policies work as expected
      1. Permissions boundaries
      1. Service control policies
      1. 2fa setup
      1. AWS-managed policies

   1. Managed Active Directory (basically Windows Active Directory)
   1. Federating with your home AD server
   1. RAM
      1. Share a VPC between accounts
      1. Certain resources can be shared with RAM
      1. Kind of a kludge outside using proper IAM policies to accomplish the same thing
   1. Cognito
      1. User pools vs identity pools
   1. Presigned requests (again)
   1. Control Tower: know basics
   1. Landing Zone: know basics (but really you should just use this)
   1. EC2 Instance Login
      1. Login to instances with Instance Connect
      1. Login to instances with Systems Manager Session Manager
      1. Behavior of SSH keys in the EC2 console
   1. GuardDuty

      1. Run a CA for your own stuff
   1. KMS
      1. Heart of all encryption functionality in the AWS universe
   1. HSM
      1. Really for compliance requirements; very expensive
   1. Roles Anywhere
      1. Access APIs with certificates instead of STS tokens
   1. IRSA
      1. Access roles from Kubernetes
   1. Shared responsibility model

### Billing
   1. AWS Budgets

   1. Having a single budget account within an org
   1. Marketplace
   1. Billing for APIs that you create using API Gateway

### Serverless
   1. ACR
   1. ECS
   1. Fargate
      1. Can run in ECS or lambda modes

   1. Provisioning with certificates
   1. Queueing messages with MQTT
   1. Device updates
### CloudFormation
   1. You do not have to know how to write a template

   1. Application discovery on VMWare
   1. Migration Hub
   1. Mainframe migration tools
   1. 3 R's, building a migration strategy
### Other services
   1. Workspaces
   1. Marketplace basics

   1. EKS - extreme basics only, this is not a Kubernetes test
   1. Elastic BeanStalk - getting old but still relevant
   1. Support tiers
   1. Outposts
   1. Look at all the stuff AWS offers for running locally on your own machine

### You specifically do not need:
   1. CloudFormation details
   1. Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet (although having a basic knowledge of all would be useful)
   1. Specific command lines
   1. More than basic knowledge of using the console
   1. AWS APIs
   1. Pricing details
   1. Names or characteristics of specific instance types
   1. Very advanced topics in networking and performance
   1. HPC

## The most important thing
The test is *extremely time limited*. The questions and answer choices are long, complicated, and often confusing. You only have about two minutes per question, so you'll have to read and understand very very quickly. _Many people who know all this material won't be quick enough to answer the questions in the time allotted._

It's vital to take practice tests in order to get into the rhythm of answering these long, winding, multi-part questions. I found ACloudGuru's practice tests to be very good, and did all of them (some multiple times). 

If you're not a native English speaker, and you're taking the test in English, it is going to be an extreme challenge. 

## Is this a useful certificate?
Yes. Understanding the array of options for building things on AWS is extremely helpful. You could easily save a company millions of dollars by going down the right path instead of the wrong one. It is also a challenging enough certificate that not too many people have it. 

However, it doesn't really require hands-on experience. You don't have to find a problem with a failing network configuration, or know how to actually write a query for any of the many databases. You could come out of this test knowing how to whiteboard a complex system perfectly, but without the experience to actually do it. 

I wish the material covered modern immutable infrastructure in more detail. Unless you're migrating old stuff, there's absolutely no reason to have traditional always-on services in a cloud environment. 

Another thing is that many of the services are extremely expensive, so they may be impractical to use at your company even if they're the right tool for the job. I've heard horror stories about companies enabling Config and suddenly increasing their bills tens of thousands of dollars! Of course AWS won't emphasize how to save money on their own platform. 

## Fun things I learned along the way
* NAT gateways are pretty expensive for personal use (at least $30/month). Can I avoid them by using IPv6 (so no NAT is required)? YES! Although a few key sites like GitHub still don't work on IPv6.
* You can create multiple accounts on AWS using `username+account1@gmail.com`, `username.account2@gmail.com`, etc. 
* ChatGPT is a great study buddy. It has very good knowledge of AWS, perhaps because so many people write about it. 
* I posted about passing the test on Twitter, and got what really appears to be a personal congratulations from AWS. I didn't tag anyone there. Very kind of them!
* Apparently if you pass ALL the AWS tests, they send you an exclusive gold jacket. This would take years, and of course the number of tests and their content will change in that time, so it's a very challenging achievement. Worthwhile? I'm not sure.

## Conclusion
This was a fantastic journey, and I'm glad I did it. I went from having detailed knowledge about a few specific AWS areas, to deep knowledge about almost every user-facing service they provide. It took me around 200 hours of study over a few months to get to that level.

I'm not sure if I'll ever be responsible for AWS in an operational capacity in the future, but I'm confident I can at least communicate with the people who are, and speak the same language. 

Plus it was a fun challenge! 

## What's next? 
I'm hoping to get high-level certifications on all 3 clouds, and do the CKA, and do a few security certs! So it's a long road ahead for me.
