## The Solutions Architect Professional certification: Why bother?

Amazon Web Services is the juggernaut of cloud computing. When I work with large tech-first companies, the question isn't whether they use AWS; it's whether they use anything else in addition to AWS. AWS is what Microsoft was in the 90's. 

{{< marginnote "I've mostly used Kubernetes in the past." >}}
That means when I'm planning out security solutions with customers, they'll use AWS terminology, concepts and practices. AWS is the lingua franca. Even on Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, or on-prem, the building blocks are going to be their own twists on AWS services. 
{{< /marginnote >}}

You could learn AWS by studying on your own, but the certificate gives you a concrete goal to study for and a little proof of your expertise at the end. So why not do it?

Out of all the AWS certificates, I chose the Solutions Architect Professional certificate because I like a challenge.  I'm hoping to get equivalent certs on the other two major clouds soon.

## The Challenge
This certificate is extremely challenging. AWS recommends two years of experience as a lead cloud architect before even starting to study for it.
It covers all areas of AWS, including networking, security, storage, compute, serverless, and the added-value services that AWS has built on top. 

I wasn't starting from scratch! I built a static site in S3 back in 2009, built various applications on top of AWS in 2012-2018, and consulted on security with AWS customers 2020-2023. Even then, it was a significant amount of work to study for and then pass this exam.

## The Process
I used three primary resources to study for the exam: 

1. AWS Documentation. AWS spends an enormous amount of time crafting high-quality documentation, so it makes sense ot use it. It is well-written and even calls out potential "gotcha" areas. But there is far too much documentation to read all of it, so you have to be selective. 
1. ACloudGuru's courses. I watched all the videos for the associate-level and professional-level exams. They are roughly 30 hours of content, combined, and include practice exams and hands-on labs.
1. Adrian Cantrill's course. This one is about 70 hours. It also includes a few practice exams. 

Overall, I found ACloudGuru to be the best for practice exams and labs, while Adrian Cantrill had far better lectures that go into much more detail. I'd recommend both resources.

{{< callout heading="Watch at 2x speed" >}}
I always find it extremely hard to pay full attention to pre-recorded online lectures because of the inconsistent pacing. I recommend going at 2x speed, and then slowing down when you don't understand something. This is better than trying to pay attention to things that you already know, and getting bored.
{{</ callout >}}

{{< callout heading="Flash cards" >}}
Spaced-repetition flash cards are an effective way to remember details. I made my on flash card app and used it a bit, although it wasn't my main means of studying. I'll link to it in the future.

## What to study

### History and context
It helps to know a bit of history. S3, EC2, and SQS were the original three AWS services, and EBS, IAM and VPCs were bolted on later. Then other services came after that. This helps you explain why S3 has its own permissions mechanism separate from IAM, or why instance stores exist outside EBS.

VPCs were added in 2009, but only made mandatory in 2021! Before VPCs, instances were connected directly to the Internet. EC2 without a VPC is called "EC2 Classic." It's likely there are still a few non-VPC instances that are still running today, and various bits of AWS do not actually depend on you having a VPC. 

There have been many high-profile breaches caused by insufficient S3 access permissions. Hence the multiple attempts at adding better security to S3. 
{{< marginnote "Nitro uses a modified Linux KVM for virtualization, but then has custom hardware for storage and networking." >}}
AWS initially used Xen virtualization under the hood, but switched completely to their own hypervisor called Nitro in around 2016. There are still old instance types and AMIs around that only support Xen. 
{{</ marginnote >}}
AWS used to let instances access their own metadata through a very simple service called IMDS. After a high profile breach, they updated to IMDSv2, which is more secure - but IMDS is still available by default. 

{{< marginnote "You'll notice this pattern a lot. Third-parties invent features on top of AWS, then AWS clones them." >}}
For most of AWS history, you had to SSH into an instance directly. A whole universe of products called "privileged access management" cropped up to restrict and monitor users SSHing into instances. AWS didn't develop just one alternative -- they now have *two*, Instance Connect and Systems Manager Session Manager (say that one ten times fast). 
{{</ marginnote >}}

{{< marginnote "AWS is on its own here. The other clouds used JWT/OIDC from the start." >}}
Also, for most of AWS history, users had fixed static Access Keys and Secret Access Keys. AWS is really trying to get away from that, with multiple different ways to get temporary Access Keys and Secret Access Keys.

{{< callout heading="Vestigial bones" >}}
Just like humans have a few vestigial bones from back when we had tails and ate raw plants, AWS has some vestigial bones from its early architecture. Here are a few examples:
*  S3 has substantially different permissions semantics from all other AWS services. 
*  S3 also has ad-hoc links to other services rather than using EventBridge.
*  PrivateLink for S3 and DynamoDB works completely differently from PrivateLink for every other service. 
*  Security groups can restrict access from other security groups, but not from VPCs (because security groups were invented before VPCs). 
*  NACLs and security groups have overlapping functionality.
*  SNS and SQS are somewhat redundant to each other, and neither really provides the pub/sub message queue that is the standard on other cloud platforms.
*  Availability zone IDs were originally completely hidden from the user and randomized per account. Then later, people wanted resources in two different accounts to be in the same AZ. So now they do have to reveal the AZ ID, but still use the old hidden method most of the time.
*  AWS first had accounts, then had multiple users within one account, and *then* added organizations as groupings of accounts. At least 90% of the time, you want your company to have one locked-down organization structure and make it impossible to share things outside that organization. This is pretty difficult to achieve with AWS.

It's useful to know roughly when AWS added new features, in order to understand why it has surprising idiosyncracies.

## Pricing
The test does not cover pricing. This makes some sense, since most companies have negotiated agreements that come with substantial discounts, and AWS changes pricing all the time. 

But you always need to remember that AWS wants you to run up as large a bill as possible. Often, the "recommended" approaches will incur hundreds or thousands of dollars a month in unnecessary expenses, when a simpler and cheaper solution is available. 

AWS is a bit like Amazon.com: They already have your credit card number, and make it very easy to spend a lot of money that you don't really need to. And they don't necessarily want to train their certified experts in how to reduce costs. 

For real-world use, remember:
1.  AWS **systematically under-prices compute and storage,** and then makes up the difference on network bandwidth pricing. I suppose they figure that if your company is just starting out, it doesn't really need much bandwidth yet; then when it's successful you'll have money to spend on bandwidth (and are already locked in). If you have bandwidth-heavy stuff like video though, use something else!
1.  The networking portions cover PrivateLink (Gateway and Interface Endpoints) and Transit Gateways. **These both have a significant added cost though,** even though they feel like they are just convenience features that shouldn't cost extra. 
1.  **Lambda is unbelievably expensive compared to just hosting the same things yourself in EC2.** It's convenient, and useful for lots of smaller projects, but anything that's going to blow up probably needs to be moved back to traditional hosting. Fargate is a nice middle ground because you can start with Lambda as the runtime, then switch it to run on ECS which is much cheaper once you need that volume.
1.  **RDS and Aurora get really expensive,** primarily because they need a ton of memory, which is often the most expensive variable in AWS instances. If at all possible, avoid them or minimize their use.
1.  **Advanced services around security are all incredibly expensive.** For example, I know companies that have accidentally spent tens of thousands of dollars in a month just by turning on Config. Presumably they have customers who really want those services, and are willing to pay big money. 

The cloud *can* be cheaper than running things in a data center, but it's not automatically cheaper. Many AWS featuers are designed to lock you in to AWS, so your bill can only grow. Any real architect needs to understand the pricing structure and steer away from the money pits.

{{< callout >}}
Most medium-sized AWS customers work with a managed service provider (MSP), who bundle up many AWS customers and negotiate shared discounts with AWS. They can also share expensive resources like DX connections (which start at $10,000 per month), and provide first-line support. Unfortunately, it does usually mean giving the MSP a great deal of control over your account, which may be unacceptable. Larger customers can negotiate discounts independently.

## _The most important thing_
The test is **extremely time limited**. The questions and answer choices are long, complicated, and often confusing. You only have about two minutes per question, so you'll have to read and understand very very quickly. _Many people who know all this material won't be quick enough to answer the questions in the time allotted._

It's vital to take practice tests in order to get into the rhythm of answering these long, winding, multi-part questions. I found ACloudGuru's practice tests to be very good, and did all of them (some multiple times).

## Is this a useful certificate?
Yes! Understanding the array of options for building things on AWS is extremely helpful. You could easily save a company millions of dollars by going down the right path instead of the wrong one. It is also a challenging enough certificate that not too many people have it. 

However, it doesn't really require hands-on experience. You don't have to find a problem with a failing network configuration, or know how to actually write a query for any of the many databases. You could come out of this test knowing how to whiteboard a complex system perfectly, but without the experience to actually do it. 

I wish the material covered modern immutable infrastructure in more detail. Unless you're migrating old stuff, there's absolutely no reason to have traditional always-on services in a cloud environment. 

## Fun things I learned along the way
* Adrian Cantrill is an incredible teacher. I do my own technical trainings sometimes, and I hope I can make mine half as good! 
* NAT gateways are pretty expensive for personal use (at least $30/month). Can I avoid them by using IPv6 (so no NAT is required)? YES! Although a few key sites like GitHub still don't work on IPv6.
* You can create multiple accounts on AWS using `username+account1@gmail.com`, `username.account2@gmail.com`, etc. And each gets $300 in AWS starting credits.
* ChatGPT is a great study buddy. It has very good knowledge of AWS, perhaps because so many people write about it. 
* I posted about passing the test on Twitter, and got what really appears to be a personal congratulations from AWS. I didn't tag anyone there. Very kind of them!
* Apparently if you pass all the AWS tests, **they send you an exclusive gold jacket.** This would be a fun challenge, especially if you can get someone else to pay for all the courses and exam fees!

## Cost of getting the certification
I was paying for all of this out-of-pocket, so cost was a concern. In total, I spent around $550:
1.  Around $80 for Adrian Cantrill's course (one time fee)
1.  $35/month for ACloudGuru access, adding up to about $150
1.  $300 exam fee
1.  About $50 of AWS fees on top of the $300 in free starting credits they give you (I accidentally left something running for a month)

I think it's worth it, but I understand not everyone has that much cash available up-front. If you can, see if your employer will pay for these expenses.

If you pass one exam from AWS, they give you a 50% off discount on your next exam. So by taking an easier (and cheaper) exam first, you may be able to save $150. 

## Conclusion
This was a fantastic journey, and I'm glad I did it. I went from having detailed knowledge about a few specific AWS areas, to deep knowledge about almost every user-facing service they provide. It took me around 200 hours of study over a few months to get to that level. I would compare it to roughly the same effort as an advanced-level college course.

I'm not sure if I'll ever be responsible for AWS in an operational capacity in the future, but I'm confident I can at least communicate with the people who are, and speak the same language. 

Plus it was a fun challenge! 

## What's next? 
I'm hoping to get high-level certifications on all 3 clouds, and do the CKA, and do a few security certs! So it's a long road ahead for me.
